Create the file `dex-config.yaml` with the following dex configuration:
```yaml {4,6,12-58,61-64}
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
  - dex.yourcompany.tld                                     # Use $DEX_HOSTNAME
config:
  issuer: https://dex.yourcompany.tld                       # "https://" + $DEX_HOSTNAME
  connectors:
  - type: saml
    id: saml
    name: SAML
    config:
      ssoURL: https://saml.example.com/sso                  # Your SSO POST URL
      # caData: ( base64 encoded PEM file )                 # CA to use when validating the signature of the SAML response.
      # insecureSkipSignatureValidation: true               # Not recommended (testing only)
      redirectURI: https://dex.yourcompany.tld/callback     # Use https:// + $DEX_HOSTNAME + /callback
      # entityIssuer: https://dex.yourcompany.tld/callback  # Optional: Use https:// + $DEX_HOSTNAME + /callback
      
      # Name of attributes in the returned assertions to map to ID token claims.
      usernameAttr: name
      emailAttr: email
      groupsAttr: groups # optional

      # List of groups to filter access based on membership
      # allowedGroups
      #   - Admins

      # Optional: Manually specify dex's Issuer value.
      #
      # When provided dex will include this as the Issuer value during AuthnRequest.
      # It will also override the redirectURI as the required audience when evaluating
      # AudienceRestriction elements in the response.

      # Optional: Issuer value expected in the SAML response.
      # ssoIssuer: https://saml.example.com/sso

      # Optional: Delimiter for splitting groups returned as a single string.
      #
      # By default, multiple groups are assumed to be represented as multiple
      # attributes with the same name.
      #
      # If "groupsDelim" is provided groups are assumed to be represented as a
      # single attribute and the delimiter is used to split the attribute's value
      # into multiple groups.
      groupsDelim: ", "

      # Optional: Requested format of the NameID.
      #
      # The NameID value is is mapped to the user ID of the user. This can be an
      # abbreviated form of the full URI with just the last component. For example,
      # if this value is set to "emailAddress" the format will resolve to:
      #
      #     urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress
      #
      # If no value is specified, this value defaults to:
      #
      #     urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent
      #
