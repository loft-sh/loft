Spaces are regular Kubernetes namespaces managed by Loft that are owned by a user or team.
In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

In Loft, each space belongs to a cluster and project. Each space also was created from a template to ensure the Kubernetes namespace and objects within it conform to isolation best practices.
You can easily manage who has access to a space and connect to it via kubectl.

:::info
For applications that require multiple namespaces or need to create cluster scoped resources, [virtual clusters](../virtual-clusters/what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx) are recommended instead.
