Each space that is created in Loft belongs to a project. There are two ways how spaces can be created inside Loft:
1. For regular project users: spaces can only be created by template that are allowed on project level.
2. For project admins: spaces can be created without template.

## Create From Template

Project members can create a new space through the Loft UI or CLI:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ui"
    values={[
      {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
      {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="ui">
      <PartialSpaceCreateUI/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli">
      <PartialSpaceCreateCLI/>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

:::tip Template Version Strings
Regardless of how you create a space from a template, either by the UI or the CLI, Loft
allows you to provide a template version string. If you do not provide this string, the latest
version will be automatically selected for you. If you *do* provide the string though, you can
do something very neat -- you can set any of the MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH version components to an
`X` wildcard character. This allows the space to be automatically updated to a more recent
template version that matches your provided template string.

For example, given a template with a version of 1.0.0, and a space created from this
template with a version string "1.X.X". Adding a new template version "1.1.0", will cause this
space to be automatically updated. Whereas adding a new version "2.0.0", will *not*
cause the space to be upgraded.

This is a very handy way to keep spaces up to date with the latest templates without
having to manually upgrade them!

Note that you can even set the version to "X.X.X" to *always* have your space updated to the
latest template version!

## Create Without Template

Only Project admins can create a virtual cluster without a template:

<PartialSpaceCreateUINoTemplate/>
