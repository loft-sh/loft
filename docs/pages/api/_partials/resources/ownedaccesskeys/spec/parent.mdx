DEPRECATED: do not use anymore
Parent is used to share OIDC and external token information
with multiple access keys. Since copying an OIDC refresh token
would result in the other access keys becoming invalid after a refresh
parent allows access keys to share that information.

The use case for this is primarily user generated access keys,
which will have the users current access key as parent if it contains
an OIDC token.
