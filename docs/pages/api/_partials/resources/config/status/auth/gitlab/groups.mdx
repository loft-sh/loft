Optional groups whitelist, communicated through the "groups" scope.
If `groups` is omitted, all of the user's GitLab groups are returned.
If `groups` is provided, this acts as a whitelist - only the user's GitLab groups that are in the configured `groups` below will go into the groups claim. Conversely, if the user is not in any of the configured `groups`, the user will not be authenticated.
