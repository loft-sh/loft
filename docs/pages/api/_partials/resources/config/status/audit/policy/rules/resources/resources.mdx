Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.

For example:
'pods' matches pods.
'pods/log' matches the log subresource of pods.
'*' matches all resources and their subresources.
'pods/*' matches all subresources of pods.
'*/scale' matches all scale subresources.

If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
overlap with each other.

An empty list implies all resources and subresources in this API groups apply.
