### `ignoreReconciliation` <span className="config-field-required" data-required="false">required</span> <span className="config-field-type">boolean</span> <span className="config-field-default">true</span> <span className="config-field-enum"></span> {#status-ignoreReconciliation}

IgnoreReconciliation tells the controller to ignore reconciliation for this instance -- this
is primarily used when migrating virtual cluster instances from project to project; this
prevents a situation where there are two virtual cluster instances representing the same
virtual cluster which could cause issues with concurrent reconciliations of the same object.
Once the virtual cluster instance has been cloned and placed into the new project, this
(the "old") virtual cluster instance can safely be deleted.
