Loft can be deployed via Helm, kubectl, Terraform, ArgoCD, Flux, and many other tools.

Using Loft CLI is the easiest way to deploy Loft to a Kubernetes cluster. If you decide later on that you want to manage your Loft instance via GitOps, you can export the applied Kubernetes manifests or the Helm chart configuration and store this data in a git repository.


## 1. Download CLI
Use one of the following commands to download the Loft CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLIFragment/>


## 2. Deploy Loft
Make sure you are using the correct kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:
```bash
loft start
```
The CLI will ask for your email address to create the admin user and then deploy Loft via Helm to your cluster.

:::tip Troubleshooting
Your Loft pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up? View our **[Troubleshooting Guide](../../getting-started/install/troubleshooting.mdx)** if you have any issues.

## 3. Login
While `loft start` is running in the background, open a second terminal window and sign in via the CLI:
```bash
loft login https://localhost:9898  --insecure     # See `loft start` output for login credentials
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the output of `loft start`.
