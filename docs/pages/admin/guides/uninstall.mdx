## Delete Helm Release
```bash
helm delete -n loft loft
```

Please make sure you also uninstall kiosk, if you have connected the loft cluster:

```bash
helm delete -n loft kiosk
```

## Delete Namespace (optional)
```bash
kubectl delete ns loft
```

If you have deleted the namespace **without** deleting the loft and kiosk helm releases beforehand, please make sure the api-services and webhooks are deleted correctly:
```bash
# loft api service and webhook
kubectl delete apiservice v1.management.loft.sh
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration loft

# kiosk api service and webhook 
kubectl delete apiservice v1alpha1.tenancy.kiosk.sh
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration kiosk
```

## Delete CRDs (optional)
```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group='storage.loft.sh' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

Delete kiosk resources (such as accounts, templates, templateinstances):
```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group='config.kiosk.sh' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

:::warning Data Loss
Deleting the Loft CRDs will also remove all Loft objects inside your cluster, e.g. `Cluster`, `Team`, and `User`. This **cannot** be undone.
:::

## Delete Admin Password (optional)
The password that was set to the admin user is encrypted and stored in a Kubernetes secret that has the name `loft-user-secret-admin` and not deleted if you are deleting the helm chart. To delete this, you have to manually run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete secret loft-user-secret-admin -n loft
```
