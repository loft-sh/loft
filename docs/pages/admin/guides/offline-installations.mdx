## Air-Gapped / Offline / VPC Clusters

If your cluster is air-gapped, within a VPC or restricts network connectivity in other ways, you
may run into issues validating the Loft license and pulling Loft images required for Loft.

To solve the licensing issue, you can either use allow HTTP requests from the Loft pod(s) to
`https://admin.loft.sh/*` (this is the preferred option), or use an
[offline license key](#offline-license-key).

To solve not being able ot pull images from Docker hub, you can
[use a private image registry](#offline-images) to host your own copies of the Loft image that
your cluster can reach.


### Offline Images

If your cluster is not able to pull images from Docker Hub, you have to push the Loft images
into your private registry. To find out which images are required, we publish a file called
`loft-images.txt` with each Loft release.

Follow these instructions to download all Loft ind import them to your private registry:

<Flow id="offline-images">
    <Step>
        <PartialAdminSetVersion/>
  </Step>
  <Step>

Set your private registry as variable:

```bash
REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam      # THIS SHOULD BE A PREFIX / DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LOFT_IMAGE PATHS
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Download the file `loft-images.txt` and the required scripts called `download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh` and make them executable:

```bash
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/loft-images.txt
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/download-images.sh
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/push-images.sh

chmod +x ./download-images.sh
chmod +x ./push-images.sh
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `download-images.sh` to download all images locally:

```bash
./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `push-images.sh` to push all downloaded images to your private registry:

```bash
./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Edit your existing `loft.yaml` file or create a new file named `loft.yaml` with content:

```yaml
image: ${REGISTRY}/ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft:${VERSION}    # Replace ${REGISTRY} and ${VERSION}
env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ${REGISTRY}       # Replace ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>
        <PartialAdminUpgrade/>
    </Step>
</Flow>


### Offline License Key

If your cluster does not allow the Loft pod to connect the Loft license server
(`https://admin.loft.sh/*`), you can contact [sales@loft.sh](mailto:sales@loft.sh) to purchase
an offline license key or to request a trial license key for offline use.

You can edit Loft install values as follows to use your offline license key:

```yaml
env:
  LICENSE_KEY: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
