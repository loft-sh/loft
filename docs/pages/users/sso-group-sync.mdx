Loft can be configured to allow for user authentication via Single-Sign-On (SSO). This feature
allows for users who have a valid account on some other service (ex: GitHub), to authenticate
and log into Loft via that service. This is a great way for administrators to not need to
manage individual users, however administrators still need a mechanism in place to ensure that
these users have appropriate permissions applied. That is where SSO groups come into play!

Most, if not all, SSO providers allow for administrators of that service to configure data that
is shared with platforms authenticating against the provider. Perhaps most important of this
shared data, is a list of groups of which the authenticating user is a part of. Upon
authentication via SSO, this group data is inspected, the user is automatically joined to any
Teams that include any of the provided group names in the `Kubernetes Groups as Members` field.
Any SSO group names that are not set in any Team's `Kubernetes Groups as Members` field will be
dynamically created as a new Team, with the group name automatically set in the `Kubernetes
Groups as Members` field.

This group behavior allows administrators to create Teams in Loft that correspond to teams in
the SSO identity provider, set the appropriate policy for those Team(s), and for users to be
automatically assigned the appropriate team, and thus privileges, upon logging in via SSO.


## Creating a Team With SSO Group Membership

<Flow id="create-team-with-sso-group-membership">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <NavStep>Teams</NavStep> button on the User Management screen.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Add Team</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, give your new team a name by replacing the
        'my-team' placeholder name, or by updating the manifest YAML 'metadata.name' field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the <Label>Team Members</Label> tab enter any desired groups into the <Label>Kubernetes
        Groups as Members</Label> field. You can add as many groups as you would like here. These group
        names must exactly match the group name that the SSO provider shares with Loft during
        SSO authentication!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Make any additional desired modifications to your new Team.
