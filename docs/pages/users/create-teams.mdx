                The <Label>Team Members</Label> tab contains settings that govern which users or
                groups are members of this team. The <Label>Users as Members</Label> selector
                allows you to include individual users directly into the team, while the
                <Label>Kubernetes Groups as Members</Label> allows you to include users whose
                standard kubernetes groups (clusterroles) match the provided values set here.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                <Label>Advanced Options</Label> allow for configuring cluster roles that apply
                to this team, as well as Image Pull Secrets, that allow users in this team to
                automatically receive the provided image pull secrets upon logging into Loft
                (via the Loft CLI).
            </Step>
            <Step>
                <Label>Access</Label> allows you to define which users and teams have access to
                modify the team you are currently creating.
