Management roles in Loft are just that, roles that can be applied to users or teams that govern
that user or teams permissions with respect to the Loft instance itself. Management Roles are
actually `ClusterRoleTemplate` objects, which in turn are just a thin wrapper around normal
Kubernetes `ClusterRole` objects. The `ClusterRoleTemplate` object is then deployed as a
`ClusterRole` to each connected cluster in the Loft deployment.

Users can create additional Management Roles, or use one of the many default roles that exist.
Some examples of default roles are as follows:

- `Cluster Admin`: a role that gives a user/team full admin privileges over connected clusters.
- `App Viewer`: a role that allows a user/team to view all Apps (but not edit them).

In many Loft deployments you can get away with using the pre-defined Management Roles, but you
are always free to create more of your own if needed.

:::info Loft Default Objects
If you don't see any Management Roles present in your Loft installation, they have either been
deleted, or, more likely, your Loft instance was deployed with the `DISABLE_DEFAULT` environment
variable set which causes Loft to *not* install default objects, including the Management Roles.

## Create Management Role

Management Roles can be created in the Loft UI.

<Flow id="create-management-role">
    <Step>
        In the Loft UI, select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left-most menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        From the User Management pane, click <NavStep>Management Roles</NavStep> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create Role</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, give your Management Role a
        name by replacing the 'my-role' placeholder name, or by updating the
        manifest YAML 'metadata.name' field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        On the <Label>Rules</Label> tab, the <Label>RBAC Rules</Label> section contains settings
        relating to the permissions that this role should grant. The rules here follow standard
        Kubernetes RBAC configuration, please see the Kubernetes
        [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more
        details.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        On the <Label>Rules</Label> tab, the <Label>Aggregation</Label> section allows users to
        include rules from other ClusterRoles into this role, by matching the additional
        ClusterRoles by label. This is a nice way to aggregate multiple smaller roles into a
        single role that can then be applied to users/teams.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Access</Label> allows you to define which users and teams have access to
        modify the role you are currently creating.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click on the <Button>Save Changes</Button> button.
    </Step>
</Flow>


## Apply Management Role

Management Roles are not very useful if they are not applied to a user or team. Applying a
Management Role can be done via the Loft UI.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="user"
    values={[
        {label: 'User', value: 'user'},
        {label: 'Team', value: 'team'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="user">
        <Flow id="apply-role-user">
            <Step>
                In the Loft UI, select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left-most menu bar.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                From the User Management pane, click <NavStep>Users</NavStep> button.
            </Step>
            <Step>

                <Label>Edit</Label> button in the drop down menu.

                Click in the <Label>Cluster Roles For User</Label> box, find the role you would
                like to apply to the user and select it. You can add as many roles ad you would
