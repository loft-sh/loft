Users can be created manually in the Loft UI as follows.

<Flow id="create-user">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Add User</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, give your new user a name by replacing the
        'my-user' placeholder name, or by updating the manifest YAML 'metadata.name' field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <b>[Optional]</b> Update the user with any additional desired configuration options.
        <Flow id="create-user-optional-ui">
            <Step>
                The <Label>Details</Label> tab contains user settings. The username is used to login and optionally you
                can also set the default password in this tab. The e-mail address needs to be unique across users and can
                also be used to login instead of using the username. The subject is used to map a user to a SSO provider.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                The <Label>Team Memberships</Label> tab contains settings that govern which
                teams the user is part of. The <Label>Teams</Label> selector
                allows you to make user part of the selected teams.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                <Label>Advanced Options</Label> allow for configuring cluster roles that apply
                to this team, as well as Image Pull Secrets, that allow users in this team to
                automatically receive the provided image pull secrets upon logging into Loft
                (via the Loft CLI).
            </Step>
            <Step>
                <Label>Access</Label> allows you to define which users and teams have access to
                modify the team you are currently creating.
