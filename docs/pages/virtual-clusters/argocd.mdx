Loft provides several points of integration with [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
a popular GitOps tool for Kubernetes. This Argo CD integration is designed to help users take
advantage not just of the speed and ease of creating virtual clusters, but also of Argo CD for
managing and deploying applications within those virtual clusters.

Argo CD Integration has three major components or levels, each layer adding additional
integration touch points.

1. Sync virtual clusters to Argo CD
2. Enable SSO Integration (sign in to ArgoCD via Loft)
3. Create Argo CD [App Project](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/)
per Loft Project

The simplest level of integration is syncing virtual clusters into Argo CD as available clusters
for deployments. In this deployment model, virtual clusters that are part of an Argo enabled
project, and have the `loft.sh/import-argocd` label set to `true` will be automatically "synced"
to Argo CD. These virtual clusters will show up as clusters that are available for deployments
in the Argo CD UI. When the virtual clusters are deleted, Loft will automatically remove the
deleted cluster from Argo CD.

The second integration level is enabling SSO integration -- this is a project level setting that
will configure Argo CD to allow users to authenticate via Loft. After enabling this setting
users who browse to the Argo CD instance will see a button to login via Loft. All members of the
project will be able to log in via Loft and gain access to Argo CD.

The final integration level is the App Project/Argo CD Project integration. This tier configures
an App Project in Argo CD that corresponds to the Loft project. This option allows for
configuring the Argo CD Project's source repositories (repositories that can be deployed to
cluster(s) in the given project), as well as RBAC roles to apply to the project.

Configuration of each of these integration modes all starts at the Loft project object. Argo CD
can be enabled on a per-project basis, where multiple projects can be configured to integrate
with a single Argo CD instance, or with different Argo CD instances depending on your requirements.

## Enable Argo CD Integration

Argo CD integration is enabled on a per-project basis. You can enable Argo CD integration during
project creation, or on an existing project.

## Enable Argo CD SSO Integration

Projects may also enable SSO integration with Argo CD -- this integration will allow all members
of the Loft project to log in to Argo CD via Loft.

:::info Pre-Requisites
The `loftHost` Loft configuration must be set to enable this integration. The `loftHost` can be
configured via loft helm values, or in the `Admin` section of the UI on the `Config` pane.

## Enable Argo CD App Project Integration

App Project integration, can be enabled by editing a project manifest and setting the
`argoCD.project.enabled` field of the project spec to 'true'. Additionally, users may
provide metadata fields to apply the Argo CD App Project object, Argo CD RBAC roles to apply,
and an array of permissible source repositories that may be accessed within the project.


## Enable Virtual Cluster Import

Once a project has Argo CD enabled, virtual clusters within that project are eligible to be
synced to the Argo instance as available clusters. You can enable virtual cluster import into
Argo CD during the virtual cluster creation step, or by enabling this feature on existing
virtual clusters.

:::info Make Sure Your Project Has Argo CD Enabled!
If the project your virtual cluster resides in does *not* have Argo CD integration enabled, you
will not see the Argo CD import option!
