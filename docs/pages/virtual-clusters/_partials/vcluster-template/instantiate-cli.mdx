When creating a virtual cluster from the Loft CLI, you will need to provide the name of the
project in which to deploy the virtual cluster, and the name of template to use:

```bash
loft create vcluster [vcluster-name] --project [project-name] --template [template-name]
```

:::info Kube-Context
Running `loft create vcluster` will automatically add a kube-context to your kube-config file, so you can immediately run `kubectl` commands right after creating a virtual cluster.
