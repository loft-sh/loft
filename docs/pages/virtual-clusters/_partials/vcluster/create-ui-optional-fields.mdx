    <Step>
        The <Label>Definition</Label> tab contains settings relating to the virtual cluster
        deployment itself, here you can provide helm values to be used when
        deploying the virtual cluster, select the virtual cluster distribution
        (ex: k3s (default), k0s, k8s), as well as configurations for sleep mode
        and ingress access.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Objects</Label> is where you can define Kubernetes manifests that should be
        created in the virtual cluster.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Apps</Label> allows you to select any pre-defined 'applications' (ex: Cert
        Manager) that should be installed into the virtual cluster.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Parameters</Label> provides a mechanism for exposing values that users should
        be able to modify when deploying a virtual cluster from this template.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Space</Label> settings allow for configuration of labels and annotations on
        the space that the virtual cluster will be created in, you can also
        define objects and <Label>Apps</Label> that should be deployed into this space.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Label>Permissions</Label> are additional access rules that can be defined for the
        virtual cluster instance.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Finally, <Label>Template Permissions</Label> are the permissions that are applied to
        the template itself -- that is, who has permission to view/edit this template.
