Loft can act as an OpenID Connect provider for other services, e.g. a self-hosted container registry using [Harbor](../integrations/harbor).

To tell Loft to act as OIDC provider, navigate to `Admin > Config` and add the `oidc` section to your config:
```yaml {2-9}
auth: ...
oidc:
  enabled: true
  clients:
  - name: "Example Client"
    clientId: "loft"
    clientSecret: "MYCLIENTSECRET"
    redirectURIs:
    - http://my-allowed-redirect-uri
# - ADD A 2nd OIDC CLIENT HERE
# - ADD A 3rd OIDC CLIENT HERE
```

To configure loft as an OIDC provider somewhere else, you can fill out the following fields with:
- OIDC Provider Endpoint / Issuer: https://loft.mycompany.tld/oidc
- OIDC Client ID: loft
- OIDC Client Secret: MYCLIENTSECRET
- Group Claim Name: groups
- Available OIDC Scopes: offline_access,openid,groups,email,profile

With this configuration your Loft users will be able to authenticate in another application using their Loft account (which may itself be based on another SSO provider).
