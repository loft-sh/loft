If you are already "GitOps-ing" all of your applications deployed into your Kubernetes cluster(s)
you may want to do the same with Loft! This short guide is intended to give you a quick rundown
of the basics of getting Loft deployed in a GitOps style. Note that there is nothing inherently
"special" or different about Loft compared to other application, so general GitOps practices
should apply nicely to Loft! Note that this guide will refer to ArgoCD, however any GitOps
tooling can be used to deploy Loft, and the general approach should remain the same!


# Basic deployment

Before continuing, you should take a look at the [installation with helm ](../admin/guides/install-with-helm)
section of the docs. As you may guess from the title, the installation with helm doc section
covers the basics of installing Loft with Helm! In general, we recommend using Helm for GitOps
deployments as well, so it is worth a few minutes to review the helm installation docs.

The most basic GitOps Loft deployment would be to simply create a helm based application and
deploy the Loft chart with any desired values. Below is a simple ArgoCD example of just that:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: loft
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: loft
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  source:
    path: ''
    repoURL: 'https://charts.loft.sh'
    targetRevision: 3.0.0
    chart: loft
    helm:
      parameters:
        # admin
        - name: admin.create
          value: 'true'
        - name: admin.username
          value: admin
        - name: admin.password
          value: password

        # ingress
        - name: ingress.enabled
          value: 'true'
        - name: ingress.host
          value: 'loft.example'
        - name: ingress.name
          value: 'loft-ingress'

        # audit
        - name: audit.enableSideCar
          value: 'true'
        - name: config.audit.level
          value: '1'

        # config
        - name: config.loftHost
          value: "https://loft.example"

  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

The above ArgoCD application would deploy Loft into the local cluster, in the "loft" namespace.
In this example there are values being passed to set some basic configurations including an
admin user/password, ingress configuration, and some basic audit configuration.

When deploying the Loft chart as above, the Loft deployment itself will deploy the Loft agent
into the local cluster for you. If you would like to manage the agent deployment yourself, see
the subsequent [agent](#Agents) section.

At its most basic, that's it!

:::warning ArgoCD and Helm Releases
If you are administering your Loft instance with ArgoCD you will be unable to update the Loft
config in the Loft UI. This should not be an issue as if you are managing Loft in a GitOps
fashion you are (hopefully) avoiding manual updates like this, but it is important to note! This is
due to ArgoCD not deploying the Helm release secret.

# Connected Clusters

One of the great benefits of Loft is that you can easily manage resources located in many
physical clusters by adding them to Loft and using Loft as your central point of management.
When you add a "connected" cluster to Loft, Loft creates a `Cluster` resource and installs a
Loft Agent in the cluster to handle local reconciliation tasks. If you are managing Loft via a
GitOps style, you may also wish to manage these connected clusters in a similar fashion (rather
than letting Loft install and manage the Agent). This section outlines some basics of how to
accomplish this.

## Cluster Resources

If you would like to manage Loft *and* Loft agents via your GitOps tooling, you likely also want
to manage the connected cluster configurations that live inside Loft. These configuration
elements inform Loft of the remote connected clusters, and how to connect to those clusters to
validate the agent installation, and to proxy kubernetes commands from the central Loft instance
to the remote cluster(s).

Each cluster requires two resources, a `Cluster` object that simply defines the cluster name and
the owner of the cluster inside of Loft, and an associated `Secret` that contains relevant
configuration information for Loft to connect to the cluster.

A common strategy for bundling cluster data with your primary Loft Application (as in ArgoCD
Application object) is to write a simple "parent" Helm chart that includes Loft as a dependency.
This parent chart can contain anything you'd like of course, but in this case would be used to
include the `Cluster`(s) objects and their associated `Secret` objects.

:::warning Cluster Secrets
The secret associated with a Cluster object necessarily includes authentication data to access
the remote cluster -- take care to ensure that this information is handled appropriately!
:::

A simple `Chart.yaml` that includes the base Loft chart as a dependency may look similar to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: loft-manager
description: A parent Helm chart for Loft
type: application
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
- name: loft
  version: 3.0.0
  repository: https://charts.loft.sh
```

Values that need to be passed to the dependent Loft chart can be passed by referring to the
dependency name, in this case, "loft". For example, if you wanted to set the `replicaCount`
value on the Loft chart, you could do as follows in a values.yaml file:

```yaml
loft:
  replicaCount: 3
```

:::info Who is managing the Loft agent?!
Remember, if you want to manage the Loft agent via your GitOps workflow, make sure you set the
`DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true" for your Loft deployment!
:::

The "parent" Helm chart can now include any additional resources that you may want to deploy
with your Loft instance -- in this case, the chart should include both the `Cluster` and
`Secret` resources for any connected clusters. You can accomplish this by having a simple
template that iterates over an array of clusters that users can provide via values, something
like the following:

```yaml
{{ range .Values.clusters }}
---
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: {{ .name }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
spec:
  access:
  - subresources:
    - '*'
    users:
    - admin
    verbs:
    - '*'
  config:
    secretName: loft-cluster-config-{{ .name }}
    secretNamespace: loft
  displayName: {{ .name }}
  owner:
    user: admin
{{ end }}

{{ range .Values.clusters }}
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config: {{ .config | b64enc }}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: loft-cluster-config-{{ .name }}
  namespace: loft
type: Opaque
{{ end }}
```

With the above template, users would provide an array of maps containing a "name" and a "config"
field. For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: my-connected-cluster
    config: |
      apiVersion: v1
      clusters:
      - cluster:
          certificate-authority-data: YOUR-CA-DATA-HERE
          server: https://1.2.3.4:6443
        name: my-connected-cluster
      contexts:
      - context:
          cluster: my-connected-cluster
          namespace: kube-system
          user: my-connected-cluster-user
        name: my-connected-cluster-context
      current-context: my-connected-cluster-context
      kind: Config
      preferences: {}
      users:
      - name: my-connected-cluster-user
        user:
          token: YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

:::warning Missing CRDs?!
You may have noticed a strange annotation on the `Cluster` resource above --
"argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true". This annotation tells
ArgoCD to skip the dry run/check of the resource. We need this for initial deployments as Loft
itself will deploy the `Cluster` CRD into the cluster. Without this annotation the Application
will be unable to be synced!
:::


## Agents

If you have disabled agent installation on your Loft deployment as outlined in the Helm
installation guide [here](../admin/guides/install-with-helm#the-loft-agent), you will need to ensure
that you are installing the Loft agent into each connected cluster. Without doing this, Loft
will not be able to do anything in the connected cluster!

The most obvious difference with managing the agents as compared to the Loft manager is that the
agents will of course need ot be installed in the connected ("remote", as in non-local to Loft
manager) cluster(s). Assuming you have successfully added the relevant cluster(s) as available
clusters in your ArgoCD configuration, you can simply create another ArgoCD Application to
manage the agent. The following is a basic example of this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: loft-agent-my-other-cluster
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: loft
    server: 'https://my-other-cluster:6443'
  source:
    path: ''
    repoURL: 'https://charts.loft.sh'
    targetRevision: 3.0.0
    chart: loft-agent
    helm:
      parameters:
        - name: env.SOMEVAR
          value: myvalue

  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

Once again, note that if you want to manage the agent deployments via ArgoCD or your GitOps
tooling of choice, you will want to ensure that the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable is set
to "true" for your Loft deployment!


# Everything Else

Love managing Loft itself with your GitOps tooling? Want to manage the resources *in* Loft with
that same tooling? Great news! You can do just that! One of the core tenants of Loft is that all
Loft resources are just "normal" Kubernetes resources. This means that you can manage any Loft
objects in the same way you'd manage any other Kubernetes resources in your GitOps workflow.

To generate the appropriate manifests to manage each Loft resource type, you may want to check
out the [API documentation](../api/resources/project) where you can find example manifests and
argument references for nearly all Loft resource types. Alternatively you can use the Loft UI to
build out your required objects and simply snag the YAML output from the build pane and use that
as your manifest content.

Here is a small example of creating a `Team`, and a `Project` that the team is a member of. You
could manage teams and projects like this in your GitOps platform, then allow project users to
create resources in Loft as they wish. This would "GitOps-ify" the core bits and allow teams to
control their own environments in Loft manually if they wish. The following manifests could be
added into a custom Helm chart, or simply used as manifests in a repo connected to ArgoCD. This
is a contrived example of course, but the main point here is that all Loft resources are just
"normal" Kubernetes (custom) resources that can be managed with your GitOps tooling, or any
other Kubernetes-centric tooling!

```yaml

apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
