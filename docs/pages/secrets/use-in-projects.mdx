Global secrets can be used in projects by creating a project secret that is synchronized by a global secret. This provides a way to manage secret data across many projects.

## Create a Project Secret using a Global Secret

When you have a shared secret defined in Loft and wish to use it inside your project, you can configure syncing between a project secret and the shared secret.
To configure this, follow these steps:
<Flow id="secret-create-project-secret-global">
    <Step>Navigate to the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> view using the menu on the left</Step>
    <Step>Select the project you'd like to configure using the drop down menu</Step>
    <Step>Click on <NavStep>Project Secrets</NavStep></Step>
    <Step>Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button</Step>
    <Step>Click on <Label>my-secret</Label> to change the display name for the secret</Step>
    <Step>Optionally click on <Label>Enter a description for this object...</Label> to add a description for the secret</Step>
    <Step>In the <Label>Optional: Select a shared secret</Label> input, select the shared secret that you wish to sync to the project secret</Step>
    <Step>Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button to save your changes</Step>
</Flow>

The global secret's data will be synchronized with the project secret momentarily. Using this configuration, updates to the shared secret will automatically propagate down to the project secret.

Once the project secret has been created, head over to the [Secret Sync](secret-sync) page to learn how to use the project secret data from a Pod.

:::note Shared Secret Permissions
When creating a project secret that refers to a shared secret you must have permissions to read the shared secret or the request will be denied.
