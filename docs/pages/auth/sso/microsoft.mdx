<Step>1</Step>

**Create Loft Config For Microsoft**

Loft is able to use Microsoft OAuth2 flow to identify the end user through their Microsoft account.

To tell Loft to use Microsoft for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml
auth:
  # Tell loft to use microsoft authentication
  microsoft:
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) tenant configuration parameter controls what kinds of accounts 
    # may be authenticated in loft. By default, all types of Microsoft 
    # accounts (consumers and organizations) can authenticate in loft via Microsoft. 
	# To change this, set the tenant parameter to one of the following:
	# common - both personal and business accounts can authenticate via Microsoft (default)
	# consumers - only personal accounts can authenticate in loft
	# organizations - only business/school accounts can authenticate in loft
	# 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' - only accounts belonging to specific tenant 
	# identified by either 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' can authenticate in loft
	tenant: common
	# (Optional) It is possible to require a user to be a member of a particular 
	# group in order to be successfully authenticated in loft.
	groups: []
	# (Optional) Configuration option restricts the list to include only security groups. 
	# By default all groups (security, Office 365, mailing lists) are included.
	onlySecurityGroups: false
	# (Optional) Restrict the groups claims to include only the user’s groups
	# that are in the configured groups
	useGroupsAsWhitelist: false
    # (Optional) Cluster Account Templates that will be automatically added for new users 
	# logging in through this authentication
	clusterAccountTemplates: 
	  # The name of the cluster account template
	- name: my-cluster-account-template
	# (Optional) A mapping between groups and cluster account templates. 
	# If the user has a certain group, the cluster account template 
	# will be added during creation
	groupClusterAccountTemplates:
	  # Name of the group from the token
	  - group: my-group
	    # Names of the cluster account templates to apply
	    clusterAccountTemplates: 
	    - name: my-cluster-account-template
```
