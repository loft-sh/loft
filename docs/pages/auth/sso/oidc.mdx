<Step>1</Step>

**Create Loft Config For OIDC**

Loft is able to use an OIDC provider as an authentication source.

To tell Loft to use OIDC for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml
auth:
 # Tell loft to allow OIDC for authentication
  oidc:
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # IssuerURL is the URL the provider signs ID Tokens as.
    issuerUrl: https://accounts.google.com 
    # ClientID the JWT must be issued for, the "sub" field. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret to issue tokens from the OIDC provider. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/oidc/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/oidc/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) Path to a PEM encoded root certificate of the provider. 
    caFile: /tmp/ca-file.crt
    # (Optional) UsernameClaim is the JWT field to use as the user's username. 
    # If not set defaults to email.
    usernameClaim: email
    # (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to username to be prefix with
	# the provided value.  
    usernamePrefix: my-prefix-
    # (Optional) If specified, causes the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
	# groups with an ID Token field.
	groupsClaim: groups
	# (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to group names to be prefixed with the
	# value.
	groupsPrefix: group-prefix-
	# (Optional) If specified, tells the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
	# information from the UserInfo. This might be necessary for slim tokens such as used
	# by Okta
	getUserInfo: false
	# (Optional) Cluster Account Templates that will be automatically added for new users 
	# logging in through this authentication
	clusterAccountTemplates: 
	  # The name of the cluster account template
	- name: my-cluster-account-template
	# (Optional) A mapping between groups and cluster account templates. 
	# If the user has a certain group, the cluster account template 
	# will be added during creation
	groupClusterAccountTemplates:
	  # Name of the group from the token
	  - group: my-group
	    # Names of the cluster account templates to apply
	    clusterAccountTemplates: 
	    - name: my-cluster-account-template
```

<Step>2</Step>

**Authenticate via OIDC**

After saving the new Loft configuration, Loft will restart itself and you should be able to log in via your OIDC provider.
