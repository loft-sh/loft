If you configure authentication through OpenID Connect (OIDC), users log in to the loft interface via an OIDC single sign-on (SSO) provider, such as Okta, KeyCloak, or dex.
In this case, you usually do not create user accounts in loft and manage them through the OIDC provider that delegates the correct authentication to external providers, such as Github, Google or Microsoft.

OpenID Connect allows users to authenticate using a third-party provider which is useful if organizations want to:
- provide self sign-up for their users
- [mirror the team memberships](#mirror-team-memberships) of their users from another provider
- enforce security standards such as two factor authentication (2FA)

OpenID Connect authentication is a paid feature of loft, so please make sure this feature is enabled in your loft instance.

## Setup Dex for Single Sign-On

If you do not already have an OIDC provider, such as dex, Okta or KeyCloak, this section will show you how to deploy dex to let your users authenticate through external OAuth providers, such as Github, Google or Microsoft.

For an extensive GitHub dex configuration take a look at the official [dex documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/Documentation/connectors/github.md).

In order to configure Github for dex, you'll have to create a new Github Application for dex and copy the client id and secret to a file called `dex-values.yaml`:
```yaml

After creating the `dex-values.yaml` for your OAuth provider (see above), you can now install dex via helm:
```
helm install dex dex --repo https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace dex \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.hosts[0]=my-dex-issuer.com \
  -f dex-values.yaml \
  --wait
```

## Configure an OIDC Provider in loft

In order to configure an OIDC provider in loft, you'll have to edit loft config in the admin section in the loft UI.
If you don't have an OIDC provider installed, check out the previous section for how to install dex.

<figure class="frame">
  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/loft-oidc-config.png" alt="loft OIDC config" />
  <figcaption>Example loft OIDC config</figcaption>
</figure>

An example configuration for an OIDC provider could look like this:
```yaml
auth:
  oidc:
    issuerUrl: http://my-dex-issuer.com   # Required: The issuer url of the OIDC provider
    clientId: ""                          # Required: Client ID to use
    clientSecret: ""                      # Required: Client Secret to use
    usernameClaim: "email"                # Optional: The username claim within the ID token to use as kubernetes subject and loft username (default: email)
    usernamePrefix: ""                    # Optional: if specified, causes claims mapping to username to be prefix with the provided value (default: '')
    groupsClaim: ""                       # Optional: GroupsClaim, if specified, causes loft to try to populate the user's groups with an ID Token field (default: '')
    groupsPrefix: ""                      # Optional: if specified, causes claims mapping to group names to be prefixed with the value (default: '')
    caFile: "/path.crt"                   # Optional: Path to ca cert of the issuer within the loft container (default: '')
    type: "github"                        # Optional: if specified, changes the button appearance in the loft UI login page (default: '')
```

Save the config and you should be able to login via your preferred OIDC provider after a couple of minutes.

For each new user that logs into loft that has not yet logged into loft, loft will create a new user object.

You can also automatically assign users based on their ID Token groups to teams ([see below](#mirror-team-memberships)), by configuring the Kubernetes Groups in a loft team.


## Mirror Team Memberships

## Disable Password Auth
To disable password authentication, change the loft config:

  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/loft-disable-password.png" alt="loft disbale password" />
  <figcaption>Disable password authentication in loft</figcaption>
</figure>


## loft as OIDC Provider
Loft can also act as an OIDC provider for other services, e.g. a self-hosted container registry using [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.0.0/administration/configure-authentication/oidc-auth/).

To configure loft to act as an OIDC provider you will have to edit the loft config under the admin section in the loft UI:

<figure class="frame">
  <img src="/docs/media/ui/auth/loft-oidc-provider-config.png" alt="loft oidc provider config" />
  <figcaption>Example loft OIDC provider config</figcaption>
</figure>

An example configuration for loft to act as an OIDC provider could look like this:
```yaml
oidc:
  enabled: true
  clients:
  - name: "Example Client"
    clientId: "example"
    clientSecret: "MYCLIENTSECRET"
    redirectURIs:
    - http://my-allowed-redirect-uri
```

To configure loft as an OIDC provider somewhere else, you can fill out the following fields with:
- OIDC Provider Endpoint / Issuer: https://my-loft-instance.com/oidc
- OIDC Client ID: example
- OIDC Client Secret: MYCLIENTSECRET
- Group Claim Name: groups
- Available OIDC Scopes: offline_access,openid,groups,email,profile

With this configuration your loft users are able to authenticate in another application that supports OIDC based authentication like Kubernetes or Harbor.
