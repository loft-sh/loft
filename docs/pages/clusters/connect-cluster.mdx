A new cluster can be connected to Loft through the UI or CLI:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ui">
    <PartialClusterConnectUI />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">
    <PartialClusterConnectCLI />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Starting with version 3.4, the Loft agent and control plane interaction can be
an egress-only connection initiated from the agent to the control plane.

<div className="flex-container" style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
  <BeforeSvg width="100%"/>
  <AfterSvg width="100%"/>
</div>

On an upgrade from a previous version to version 3.4, existing connected clusters
managed by the control plane will get automatically upgraded and transformed into
egress-only agents.
Following the agent upgrade, firewall/security group rules allowing direct access
to the Kubernetes API server can be removed.

When connecting a new cluster, the user creates a new cluster resource and obtains
a pre-shared key that the user then uses to bootstrap the agent.
The agent then utilizes this PSK to reach the control plane, authenticate itself,
and establish a secure WireGuard-based, user-space secure tunnel.

If the agent cannot establish a direct WireGuard-based connection, the agents will
utilize the control plane as a Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets. The control
plane relay is comparable to the same role as TURN servers in the ICE standard,
using HTTPS streams (or WebSockets) and WireGuards keys instead.
