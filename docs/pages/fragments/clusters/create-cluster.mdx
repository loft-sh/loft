```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run this command inside the loft management cluster
kubectl apply -f cluster.yaml
```

:::note Cluster Status
After creating the cluster resource, the Loft controller will detect the new cluster and initialize it, i.e. it will install the kiosk helm chart into the cluster. To check if the cluster has been initialized, run:
```bash
kubectl get cluster -o custom-columns=NAME:metadata.name,PHASE:status.phase
```
