In Loft, access to a cluster is defined by a cluster account. A cluster account is an object created in each connected cluster that references a user or team and defines which access and restrictions apply. Every one of these clusters can run in a different availability zone or even in a different cloud platform etc. So, you can connect, for example, EKS clusters from AWS and GKE clusters from Google Cloud and then give people access depending on what they need to work with.
