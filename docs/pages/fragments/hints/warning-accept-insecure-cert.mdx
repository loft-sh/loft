:::caution Accept Untrusted Certificate
Since Loft generates a self-signed SSL certificate, you need to run `loft login` with the `--insecure` flag and once the browser opens, you will also need to **accept the untrusted self-signed certificate** before the login page will show up. Once you [connect a domain](../../getting-started/domain) to Loft later on, you can use your own, valid certificates or have one provisioned via `cert-manager`.
