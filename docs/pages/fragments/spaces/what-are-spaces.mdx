Spaces are virtual objects which represent namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster. The advantage of letting engineers work with spaces is that you can give them the permission to list/get/create/delete spaces without having to give them the permission to list/get/create/delete namespaces. 

While engineers work with spaces, loft handles the underlying operations on the actual namespaces and enforces the restrictions that admins define for users, e.g. limting the number of spaces/namespaces.
