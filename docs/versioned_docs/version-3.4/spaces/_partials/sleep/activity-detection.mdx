<span>All requests that are made through Loft count as activity in the {props.name}</span>.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  kubectl("<code>kubectl get pod my-pod</code>") --> Loft

  Loft("<img src='/docs/media/loft-logo-white.svg' width='60' height='30' />")

  Loft --> Cluster("Connected Cluster <br/> Kubernetes API Server")
  Cluster --> Pod("<pre>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\n...</pre>")

  class kubectl code
  class Pod yaml
  class Loft loft
```

If your kube-context points to Loft's API server as a proxy before the actual connected cluster's API server, every `kubectl` request will be an activity and reset the inactivity timeout.

### Ingress Requests

For ingress-nginx based ingresses, activity detection also works automatically. Other ingress controllers are currently not supported. For nginx based ingresses, Loft will add a special annotation to each ingress that will track activity and reset the timer as soon as a request is made to that ingress.

:::info Ingress Wakeup
<span>Loft supports waking up a {props.name} through an ingress independent of the underlying ingress controller. Just navigate to the ingress host and you should see a Loft wakeup page for the {props.name}.</span>
