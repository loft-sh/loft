To see a list of spaces, go to the <NavStep>Spaces</NavStep> view using the main menu on the left.

:::info Spaces & Namespaces
If you are admin in one of the clusters connected to Loft, you will have permission to view all namespaces in the cluster. Since spaces and namespaces have a 1:1 relationship and Loft is often relying on regular Kubernetes RBAC, you will be able to see all namespaces in the <NavStep>Spaces</NavStep> view rather than just namespaces created via Loft.
