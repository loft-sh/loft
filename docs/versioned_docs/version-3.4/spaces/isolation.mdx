Spaces in Loft can be configured to provide moderate levels of isolation. This "isolation"
typically includes applying ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, and NetworkPolicies to a Space. These
policies can be configured using the Space `Objects` option, to provide your desired quotas,
limits and network policies. To make your life easier, Loft is deployed with a default Space
Template called `Isolated Space Template`. This space template can give you a head start on
configuring your own Space isolation policies, or you may find the template sufficient for your
needs.

The default `Isoalted Space Template` creates hard limits for resource types, sets rational
default limit ranges, and deploys a rather restrictive NetworkPolicy limiting network traffic.

:::warning CNIs and Network Policies
Not all CNIs will support all network policies! Make sure you understand what capabilities your
CNI supports when investigating space isolation!
