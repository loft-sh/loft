Users can be locked, to temporarily suspend their access to Loft. By doing so, the user won't be
able to login or access any spaces / virtual clusters anymore. Access keys generated for the
user won't work anymore as long as the user is locked. This is a useful feature to temporarily
lock an user if you want to preserve the users environments without deleting the user.

<Flow id="lock-user">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.

        <Label>Lock User</Label> from the menu options.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        To unlock the user, select <Label>Unlock User</Label> from the same drop down menu.
