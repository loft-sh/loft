This feature allows you to deploy the vCluster control plane in one cluster and the actual workloads into another cluster.

:::info Pre-Requisites
Currently this feature only works through a LoadBalancer.
Hence the user needs to make sure that their control plane
is able to schedule LoadBalancers that fill the `status.Ingress` field
correctly with either and IP or a hostname. Compatibility has been tested
in Google Cloud and AWS.

Another requirement for this feature is that it expects a kube config to a headless vcluster installation,
hence the target vcluster must be deployed as a headless vcluster.
:::

#### Create the remote vcluster

Put the following configuration in `VirtualClusterInstance` resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterInstance
...
...
spec:
  template:
    helmRelease:
      chart:
        name: vcluster
        repo: https://charts.loft.sh
      # add any other values you want here
      values: |-
        service:
          type: LoadBalancer
    # This field is required to make sure Loft knows about deploying the workloads into a separate cluster
    workloadVirtualClusterTemplate: {}
    # You can specify specific workload cluster helm values via
    # helmRelease:
    #   values: ...
  # This is the reference to the cluster where the control-plane is running
  clusterRef:
    namespace: vcluster-platform
    virtualCluster: my-vcluster
    cluster: cluster-1              # the k8s cluster where the vcluster control plane runs
  # This is the reference to the cluster where the workloads are running
  workloadClusterRef:
    namespace: vcluster-workloads
    virtualCluster: my-vcluster
    cluster: cluster-2              # the k8s cluster where the actual workloads run
```

This will deploy the control-plane into `cluster-1` and the workloads into `cluster-2`.
