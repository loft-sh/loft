Each virtual cluster that is created in Loft belongs to a Project. There are two primary ways which
virtual clusters can be created inside Loft: from a template, and manually.

Virtual clusters created from a [template](../virtual-clusters/templates) inherit all template
settings. Regular project users (non project admins) are only allowed to create virtual clusters
from templates that the project administrator has allowed. This ensures that virtual clusters in
each project adhere to the standards set by the project owner.

Project owners and Loft admins can create virtual clusters manually, that is without a template.


## Create From Template

Project members can create a new virtual cluster through the Loft UI or CLI:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ui"
    values={[
      {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
      {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="ui">
      <PartialVirtualClusterCreateUI/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli">
      <PartialVirtualClusterCreateCLI/>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

:::tip Template Version Strings
Regardless of how you create a virtual cluster from a template, either by the UI or the CLI, Loft
allows you to provide a template version string. If you do not provide this string, the latest
version will be automatically selected for you. If you *do* provide the string though, you can
do something very neat -- you can set any of the MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH version components to an
`X` wildcard character. This allows the virtual cluster to be automatically updated to a more recent
template version that matches your provided template string.

For example, given a template with a version of 1.0.0, and a virtual cluster created from this
template with a version string "1.X.X". Adding a new template version "1.1.0", will cause this
virtual cluster to be automatically updated. Whereas adding a new version "2.0.0", will *not*
cause the virtual cluster to be upgraded.

This is a very handy way to keep virtual clusters up to date with the latest templates without
having to manually upgrade them!

Note that you can even set the version to "X.X.X" to *always* have your virtual cluster updated
to the latest template version!

## Create Without Template

Only Project admins can create a virtual cluster without a template:

<PartialVirtualClusterCreateUINoTemplate/>
