The vcluster project provides several configuration options pertaining to virtual cluster
isolation and security. This section briefly covers the primary configuration options, users are
encouraged to check out the full vcluster isolation and security docs page
[here](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/operator/security).

vcluster provides a configuration option simply named `isolate`. When enabled, this feature
enables a pod security standard, deploys a resource quota and limit range, and enables a network
policy to isolate workloads.

Enabling of the vcluster `isolate` configuration setting is as simple as setting the appropriate
value in your virtual cluster or virtual cluster template helm values as shown below:

```yaml
isolation:
  enabled: true
```

All vcluster isolation mode configuration settings are available for further configuration by
making use of the provided helm values. Take a look the vcluster docs linked below for much more
information about both the default settings and available configurations.

Not all CNIs will support all network policies! Make sure you understand what capabilities your
CNI supports when investigating virtual cluster isolation!
