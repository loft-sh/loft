As outlined in the 'What are Apps' section, Apps are helm charts, kubernetes manifests, or bash
scripts, with optional parameters, that define an "application" that can be deployed into a
cluster, space, or virtual cluster.

Creating Apps is done via the Loft UI.

<Flow id="create-app">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Templates</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the Apps option on the templates pane.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Add App</Button>.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, give your new app a name by replacing the
        'my-app' placeholder name, or by updating the manifest YAML 'metadata.name' field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        On the <Label>Definition</Label> configuration pane, select the type of app you would
        like to create (kubectl, helm, or bash), and enter the appropriate information for the
        given app type. This section is largely an exercise for the user as each type of
        application has different required fields, and the contents will be specific to each
        users environment.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <b>[Optional]</b> select the <Label>Display Options</Label> configuration pane and
        provide an icon for your app. This icon will be displayed on the "Apps" page of clusters,
        spaces and virtual clusters.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <b>[Optional]</b> select the <Label>Display Options</Label> configuration pane, from the
        <Label>Recommended App</Label> drop down box, select one of the choices. This choice
        affects where the App will show up as "recommended" in the UI.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create App</Button> button.
    </Step>
</Flow>
