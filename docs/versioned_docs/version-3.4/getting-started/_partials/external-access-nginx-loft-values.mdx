To update the Loft deployment to use the NGINX ingress controller, we can create a simple values
file that tells Loft to do just that. If you created a values file during your initial
deployment, you can simply edit that file, if you did not, you can create a new file with the
following contents.

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: "loft.mydomain.tld"   # Make sure to change this
  ingressClass: "nginx"       # Optional, nginx is default value!
```
