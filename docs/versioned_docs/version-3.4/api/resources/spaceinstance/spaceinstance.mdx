Spaces are regular Kubernetes namespaces managed by Loft that are owned by a user or team. In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

## Example Space

An example Space:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: SpaceInstance
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: my-space
  namespace: loft-p-my-project
spec:
  clusterRef: {}
  displayName: my-display-name
  owner:
    user: my-user
  parameters: 'my-parameter: my-value'
  templateRef:
    name: my-space-template
status: {}

```
