CertificateTTL holds the ttl (in seconds) to set for the certificate associated with the
returned kubeconfig.
This field is optional, if no value is provided, the certificate TTL will be set to one day.
If set to zero, this will cause loft to pass nil to the certificate signing request, which
will result in the certificate being valid for the clusters `cluster-signing-duration` value
which is typically one year.
