Teams are composed of multiple users and define a way to manage cluster access or other objects for multiple users at once. You can assign users automatically to teams by their groups, which can be synced from an authentication provider. Teams can also access Loft through their own access keys and own spaces or other objects.

## Example Team

An example Team:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: my-team
spec:
  clusterRoles:
  - name: loft-management-admin
  description: All users in this team have full admin access to all clusters
  displayName: Global Admins
  groups:
  - loft:admins
  username: loftadmins
status: {}

```
