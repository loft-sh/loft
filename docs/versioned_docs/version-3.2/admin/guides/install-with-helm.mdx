Loft can be installed directly via Helm, in fact, even when following the recommend installation
procedure in the Getting Started Guide the Loft CLI is actually using Helm to install Loft!

Managing the Loft installation with Helm directly can be a great way to "GitOps" your Loft
installation, by using ArgoCD or other GitOps tools to manage the Loft deployment via Helm and
appropriate Helm values. This section outlines the basics of installing and managing Loft with
Helm, and should serve as a solid starting point for managing Loft in a GitOps fashion as well!


## Simple Installation

The most basic Loft installation via Helm looks like any other Helm install command and can be
seen below:

```bash
helm upgrade [RELASE NAME] loft --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace loft
```

Typically, users will simply call the release name `loft`. If the 'loft' namespace does not
already exist, you can add the `--create-namespace` flag as well, for a final installation
command as follows:

```bash
helm upgrade loft loft --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --create-namespace
```


## Loft Values

As with most Helm charts, the Loft chart supports many user configurable values to modify the
installation. You can find the Loft chart in the Loft public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/charts/loft). The `values.yaml` file in the
chart repository contains the default values, as well as many comments showing optional values
and some additional information.

Users can copy the default values file and modify it to suite their deployment needs, or create
a new YAML file containing only the desired values settings. An example values file `myvalues.
yaml` is outlined below.

```yaml
config:
    audit:
        enabled: true
    loftHost: loft.mytld.com

ingress:
    enabled: true
    host: loft.mytld.com
```

Values files can then be passed to the Helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm upgrade loft loft --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --create-namespace \
  --values myvalues.yaml
```

You can provide multiple values files if desired by specifying additional filenames after the
`--values` flag. This can be handy if you like to break up the values sections into different files.

Helm has many additional flags, and other ways to pass values, as always, its a great idea to
check out the Helm [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/) to stay up to date on Helm!


## Loft Configuration

The Loft Configuration options (as seen in the Loft UI `Admin` > `Config` section) are
configurable via Loft Helm values just like any other deployment options. These values are set
under the `config` section of the chart values, you can see the available configuration options
in the Configuration Section of the docs [here](../config).

While all configuration settings are optional, it is always recommended to deploy Loft with the
`loftHost` configuration set. This config option tells Loft what its own publicly resolvable
hostname is and is necessary for some integrations, including ArgoCD, and SSO.


## The Loft Agent

Every connected cluster in a Loft environment, including the "main" cluster that Loft is
deployed in, must have a Loft Agent deployed. This agent pod handles reconciliation of cluster
scoped (as in not Loft instance wide) resources.

By default, when Loft is installed, the Loft pod will *also* install the Loft Agent into the
cluster you are deploying Loft into. This is usually a desirable behavior since Loft requires
the Agent to be present in all clusters. Sometimes, however, admins wish to manage the
installation of the Loft Agent themselves, either by installing it explicitly, or by installing
it via GitOps tooling. In this situation, it is possible to disable the Agent deployment by
setting the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true". This can be accomplished in the
`env` section of the Loft values:

```yaml
env:
    DISABLE_AGENT: true
```

It is also possible to tell Loft not to install Agents into individual clusters -- this can be
accomplished by setting the `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent` Annotation of the Cluster resource to
"true" for any clusters that Loft should *not* manage the Agent deployment on.

:::warning Loft Agent Is Required!
The Loft Agent is *required* for every connected cluster in a Loft deployment, this includes the
cluster Loft itself is deployed into. If you are disabling the agent deployment via one of the
mechanism described above, make sure you are still getting an Agent installed into every
connected cluster by some other means!
:::

If you are electing to manage the Agent installation yourself, you can install the Agent
directly using Helm.

```bash
helm upgrade loft-agent loft-agent --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --create-namespace
```


## Loft Agent Values

As with the primary Loft chart, the Loft Agent chart exposes values that can be configured by an
administrator to suite their needs. As with the primary Loft deployment, the Agent chart and
values can be seen in the public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/blob/master/charts/loft/values.yaml).

If you have deployed Loft with the default behavior of *not* disabling the Agent deployment, you
can still provide values to influence the deployment of the Agent itself. This can be
accomplished by providing any valid Agent values in the `agentValues` section of the *Loft*
chart values. These values are received by the Loft deployment and used when deploying the Agent
pods! Below is an example of the Loft values `agentValues` section.

```yaml
agentValues:
    securityContext:
        enabled: true
```

Administrators can also provide Agent values for *specific clusters* by setting the `loft.
sh/agent-values` Annotation of a specific cluster object. These values will always override any
values provided in the parent Loft chart.
