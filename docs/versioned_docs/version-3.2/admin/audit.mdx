Loft auditing provides a security-relevant, chronological set of records documenting the sequence of actions in loft. Loft audits the activities generated by users and by applications that use the Loft API.

Loft is able to log activities related to:
* Management Instance changes, such as creation of new virtual clusters, spaces etc.
* Changes within a virtual cluster or space
* Changes within a connected cluster

Auditing in Loft is very similar to [auditing Kubernetes clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/) in general.


## Enable Auditing

Loft auditing is configured through the Loft config in the Loft UI (Admin -> Config).

An example configuration could look like:
```yaml
audit:
  enabled: true
  level: 1
```

:::warning Loft Restart Required
Changing the Loft auditing configuration requires a restart to take effect. You can restart Loft either through the Loft UI or via kubectl: `kubectl rollout restart deploy/loft -n loft`
:::

Each request on each stage of its execution generates an audit event, which is then pre-processed according to a certain policy and written to a backend (currently only log backends are supported). The policy determines what's recorded and the backends persist the records.

Each request can be recorded with an associated stage. The defined stages are:

- `RequestReceived` - The stage for events generated as soon as the audit handler receives the request, and before it is delegated down the handler chain.
- `ResponseComplete` - The response body has been completed and no more bytes will be sent.
- `Panic` - Events generated when a panic occurred.

:::info
The audit logging feature increases the memory consumption of Loft because some context required for auditing is stored for each request. Memory consumption depends on the audit logging configuration.
:::

## Audit Levels

For easier configuration, Loft provides audit levels, that are preconfigured audit policies for the most common use cases. These levels range from 1 to 4 where 1 logs the fewest requests, while 4 logs the most. A more detailed description can be found below:

* **Level 1**: will log modifying requests such as creation / modification or deletion of any objects
* **Level 2**: like Level 1 but will also log the metadata of reading requests, such as listing pods inside a virtual cluster or space. It won't log the response or request payload and instead only the metadata such as request origin, target etc.
* **Level 3**: like Level 2 but instead of only logging the request metadata will also log the complete request payload sent to Loft
* **Level 4**: like Level 3 but instead of only logging metadata and request payload, will also log the response Loft has sent to the requester

:::info
For all of these levels certain internal read-only apis are not logged since those might pollute the log and drastically increase log size. If you also want to log these, please create a custom audit policy as described below.
:::

You can configure the audit level through the Loft config, that can be modified either through the Loft UI or helm:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ui"
    values={[
      {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
      {label: 'Helm', value: 'helm'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="ui">
        <ConfigureAuditLevelsUI />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="helm">
        <ConfigureAuditLevelsHelm />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Optional: Audit Policy

:::warning
It is recommended to use audit levels instead of audit policy directly, because a policy is much more complex to define.
:::

As an alternative to Audit levels, policy allows you to define exact rules about what events should be recorded and what data they should include. When an event is processed, it's compared against the list of rules in order. The first matching rule sets the audit granularity of the event. The defined audit granularity options are:

- `None` - don't log events that match this rule.
- `Metadata` - log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but not request or response body.
- `Request` - log event metadata and request body but not response body. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
- `RequestResponse` - log event metadata, request and response bodies. This does not apply for non-resource requests.

An example policy that catches all requests would look like this:
```yaml
audit:
  enabled: true
  policy:
    rules:
    - level: Metadata
      omitStages:
      - RequestReceived
```

## Persisting Audit Logs

There are 2 ways how to persist Loft audit logs. Either you can deploy Loft with a persistent volume claim or let Loft connect to a persistent database. The PVC approach does not work for HA mode for Loft.

### Deploy Loft with a PVC to save Audit Logs

Create a new `values.yaml` with the following values:
```yaml
audit:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    # size: 30Gi
```

Then apply the values via helm:
```yaml
helm upgrade loft -n loft --version $VERSION \
                          --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
                          --reuse-values \
                          -f values.yaml
```

### Use a persistent database as Loft audit backend

Go to Admin > Config and specify the following Loft config setting:
```yaml
audit:
  dataStoreEndpoint: mysql://username:password@tcp(hostname:3306)/database-name
```

Then press Apply and wait until Loft is restarted.

## Viewing and Exporting Audit Logs

By default, Loft will log audit events to the following locations:
* To a log file in json format located at `/var/log/loft/audit.log` inside the Loft container. Each line inside the log represents a single audit event.
* To an internal sqlite storage located at `/var/log/loft/audit.db` inside the Loft container. This sqlite database is used to display audit log events in the Loft UI. By default audit events in the sqlite are not persisted, so restarting Loft will clear the database. Instead of using a sqlite database, Loft is also able to write those events to a persistent mysql database that can be configured through the Loft config. E.g.:
```yaml
audit:
  enabled: true
  dataStoreEndpoint: mysql://username:password@tcp(hostname:3306)/database-name
```

### Enable Audit SideCar

To easily export the audit events to third party systems, we recommend to enable the audit log sidecar that will print all the audit events onto stdout in a separate container which then can be easily watched and exported.
Enabling the sidecar is only possible through helm values.

Create a `values.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
audit:
  enableSideCar: true
```

:::warning
You cannot configure this under Admin > Config, since this requires a change in the Loft deployment itself, which is why this is a helm option only
:::

Then update the helm release via:
```
helm upgrade loft loft --namespace loft \
                       --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
                       --version $LOFT_VERSION \
                       --reuse-values \
                       --values values.yaml
```

Wait until Loft has restarted, then you can view the audit logs via:
```
kubectl logs -n loft -l app=loft -c audit -f
```

### Audit Config Reference

<AuditConfiguration />

## How does Audit Logging work for Direct Cluster Endpoints?

If the direct cluster endpoint feature is enabled, Loft audit configuration is synced to each agent and each Loft agent will propagate audit events that it receives back to the central Loft instance, which then logs it as a regular audit event. Such "propagated" events can be identified through the `annotations.audit.loft.sh/sent-by-agent` identifier in an audit event.

:::info Disable Agent Sync Back
You can disable event sync back from the agent to the central loft instance via the audit config option `disableAgentSyncBack`.
