Apps in Loft are a way for admins to package applications and scripts in consumable packages.
These Apps can then be deployed into clusters, spaces, or virtual clusters.

An example application, and one that comes packaged in a default Loft deployment, is the 'Cert
Manager' app. This app, as you may guess from the name, deploys the
[cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) controller into a cluster, space or
virtual cluster.

Apps can be an existing or custom (user provided) helm chart, a Kubernetes manifest, or a bash
script that installs resources into a given destination (cluster, space, or virtual cluster).
Importantly, Apps can have *parameters*, that is, values that a user can provide to modify the
deployment of an application.

An overly simple and silly App example, could be an app that simply installs a configmap into
the given destination. This app could accept input parameters from a user to modify the contents
of the configmap. For example, the configmap could contain a data field 'env', with a default
value of 'dev'. An administrator could configure the app to accept a parameter called 'env' that
has three valid values 'dev', 'test', 'stage'. When a user deploys this app, they will be
prompted to select a value from the administrator provided values for this 'env' parameter. The
administrator can then refer to this parameter in the configmap manifest, properly setting the
environment based on the user input.

This is a simple, contrived, example of an app, but they can be much more elaborate and powerful.
Apps can give administrators a very flexible way to constrain what resources can be
deployed into clusters, while still affording users some flexibility by exposing parameters to
customize the app deployment.
