In Loft, you can also configure *multiple* SSO providers together. This can be a very handy feature if you
have multiple groups using different authentication providers based on team or geographical
region. Configuration of multiple SSO providers *of the same type* is also possible.
The latter is configured by using the "connectors" option. Below is an example Loft config "auth"
section that contains three SSO providers (one OIDC, and two GitHub providers). When users log
into Loft with such a configuration present, they will see three options for authentication as
well as the default user/password box (which can be disabled if desired).

```yaml
auth:
  github:
    clientId: test123
    clientSecret: test123
    redirectURI: https://my-loft-url/auth/github/callback
  oidc:
    clientId: test
    clientSecret: test
    issuerUrl: https://example-issuer.com
    redirectURI: https://my-loft-url/auth/oidc/callback
  # If you want to use multiple SSO configs of the same type you can use the connectors option
  connectors:
      # the id of the connector that will show up in the loft callback url
    - id: test
      # name to show in the UI
      displayName: Test GitHub
      # any regular sso config
      github:
        clientId: test
        clientSecret: test
        # Make sure to exchange test here with the connector id if you change that
        redirectURI: https://my-loft-url/auth/test/callback
```
