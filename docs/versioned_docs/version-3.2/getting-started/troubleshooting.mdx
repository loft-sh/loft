While we hope you don't run into any issues while deploying Loft, it sometimes happens! This
page contains some information that may help you resolve deployment issues. If you're still
stuck, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.loft.sh/) where you can find a #Loft channel
where you can ask other questions!


## Troubleshooting Tips

### Flag `--reset`

If you need a clean Loft installation, you can use the `--reset` flag to tell Loft CLI to purge
any previous Loft installs:

```bash
loft start --reset    # --insecure  ...add any other `loft start` flags if needed
```


### Debug `ImageErr` + `ImagePullBackOff`

If your Loft pods are not starting because the Loft images cannot be pulled, you may need to
[use a private image registry](../admin/guides/offline-installations/#offline-images) rather than
pulling Loft images from Docker Hub.


### Use Port-Forwarding

You can always try to connect to Loft directly and circumvent any potential networking issues
introduced at the load balancer and ingress controller level.

To start port-forwarding, either use `loft start` or run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/loft -n loft 8080:443
```

After that you can access Loft at `https://localhost:8080`. You can even login with the Loft CLI
to this URL with:

```bash
loft login localhost:8080 --insecure
```

If you can access Loft via port-forwarding only, this is usually an indicator that the problem
might be related to a misconfigured LoadBalancer or Ingress Controller.
