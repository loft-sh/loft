This example shows how to create and delete a virtual cluster for testing an application named `my-app` on pull requests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vclusters.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Loft CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-loft@main
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          access-key: ${{ secrets.LOFT_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Create Virtual Cluster for PR
        uses: loft-sh/create-vcluster@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
      - name: Delete PR Virtual Cluster
        uses: loft-sh/delete-vcluster@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-vcluster) action is used to create a unique virtual cluster using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
6. Finally, the [Delete Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-vcluster) GitHub Action is used to delete the virtual cluster.
