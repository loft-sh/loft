Virtual clusters managed by Loft have 100% feature parity with the open-source vcluster project,
that is, any configuration options available in the vcluster project are available for
configuration from within your Loft deployment.

There are three primary configuration components for virtual clusters, the distribution, the
vcluster version, and any values that should be passed to the vcluster deployment.


# Distributions

The distribution of a vcluster is the actual Kubernetes distribution that is deployed in the
virtual cluster. By default, this is `k3s`, however other distributions are supported. Please
see the vcluster [documentation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/operator/other-distributions) for
additional information pertaining to virtual cluster distributions.

In the context of Loft, virtual cluster distributions can be configured when deploying virtual
clusters via the Loft UI as follows.

<Flow id="create-vcluster-with-vclusterdistribution">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select the project you'd like to create the virtual cluster instance in from the Project
        drop down menu.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Select</Button> button to skip selecting a virtual cluster template.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, you should see a <Label>Virtual
        Kubernetes Distribution</Label> drop down box. Select your desired distribution from
        this drop down box.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
        <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
    </Step>
</Flow>

# vcluster Version

The vcluster Version is the actual version of the vcluster project to use in the virtual cluster.
You can check out the vcluster releases on the vcluster [release page](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases).

Providing the vcluster version is optional, if you do not provide a version, the Loft will
create the virtual cluster with the default version associated with current version of Loft.

<Flow id="create-vcluster-with-vclusterversion">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select the project you'd like to create the virtual cluster instance in from the Project
        drop down menu.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Select</Button> button to skip selecting a virtual cluster template.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, you should see a <Label>Virtual
        Cluster Version</Label> text box. Enter the desired version in the format `vX.Y.Z`, for
        example `v0.13.0`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
        <Button>Save Changes</Button> button.
    </Step>
</Flow>

# vcluster Values

Virtual clusters settings are configurable via helm values. Virtual clusters created via Loft
can be provided any desired helm values. Please refer to your distribution of choice's helm
values in the vcluster repository helm charts [directory](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/charts).

<Flow id="create-vcluster-with-vclustervalues">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select the project you'd like to create the virtual cluster instance in from the Project
        drop down menu.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Select</Button> button to skip selecting a virtual cluster template.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, you should see a <Label>Helm Values for
        Virtual Cluster Chart</Label> text box. Enter any desired helm values in this field --
        note that the text entered must be valid YAML, and the values should correspond to
        appropriate value fields in your charts values!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
        <Button>Save Changes</Button> button.
    </Step>
