Apps in Loft are a way for admins to package applications and scripts in consumable packages.
These Apps can then be deployed into clusters, spaces, or virtual clusters. This section is
about using Apps in conjunction with virtual clusters, to read more about Apps in general,
please see the full [Apps section](../apps/what-are-apps).

Virtual clusters combined with Apps are a great way to create repeatable, pre-packaged
development, testing, or even production environments. Once an App has been created in the Loft
instance, it can be installed into any virtual cluster -- either at time of creation, or into
existing virtual clusters. This gives administrators the capability to create fully populated
development, test, or even production, environments in a single easy to manage package!

:::info Virtual Cluster Templates
Virtual cluster templates can take this combination of virtual clusters and apps to the next
level, by creating simple, reusable, version-able templates that define a reproducible environment!

            <Step>
                Select the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                From the project drop-down menu, select the project you'd like to create the
                virtual cluster in.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the Virtual Clusters option on the project pane.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button on the right side of
                the page.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                <b>[Optional]</b> select the cluster in which to create the virtual cluster.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the <Button>Select</Button> to continue.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the <Label>Apps</Label> configuration tab. <br></br><br></br><b>Note:</b>
                the apps defined in this section of the template configuration are apps to be
                deployed *in* the virtual cluster!
            </Step>
            <Step>
                From the drop down menu <Label>Please select an App...</Label> select an App that you
                would like to be included as part of the template. You can select as many Apps
                as you would like here by simply selecting another App from the drop down menu.
                If you accidentally add one, or add one you do not want, click the trash icon
                next to the Apps name to remove it from the template.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                For each App you added to the template, you can configure the default namespace,
                and any App parameters supplied by the App. For helm Apps you can also configure
                the helm release-name.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
                <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.

:::info Virtual Cluster Templates
If you are creating a virtual cluster from a template, you will need to configure the App in the
virtual cluster template itself!
