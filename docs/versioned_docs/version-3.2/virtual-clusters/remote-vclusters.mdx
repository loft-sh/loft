This feature allows you to deploy the vcluster control plane in one cluster and the actual workloads into another cluster.

:::info Pre-Requisites
Currently this feature only works through a LoadBalancer.
Hence the user needs to make sure that their control plane
is able to schedule LoadBalancers that fill the `status.Ingress` field
correctly with either and IP or a hostname. Compatibility has been tested 
in Google Cloud and AWS.

Another requirement for this feature is that it expects a kube config to a headless vcluster installation,
hence the target vcluster must be deployed as a headless vcluster.
:::

We have released a separate loft version for this feature `v3.2.0-beta.1`, which you can install via:
```
helm upgrade loft loft -n loft --repo https://charts.loft.sh --version v3.2.0-beta.1
```

#### Deploy a headless vcluster
The first step is to have a headless vcluster deployed. This will be used as the
remote vcluster. One can deploy this with the `headless` option of the vcluster.
Headless mode basically means â€“ no deployment or statefulset will be created for the vcluster

```
headless: true
```

#### Create the remote vcluster

Put the following configuration in `VirtualClusterInstance` resource. For now please make sure that 
the `vcluster-pro` chart is used and specifically version `v0.1.0-beta.1`.  
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterInstance
...
...
spec:
    template:
        helmRelease:
        chart:
            name: vcluster-pro              # make sure to use the vcluster.pro chart
            repo: https://charts.loft.sh
            version: v0.1.0-beta.1          # version v0.1.0-beta.1 must be used for now
        # add any other values you want here
        values: |-
            service:
            type: LoadBalancer
            sync:
            nodes:
                enabled: true
        # This field is required to make sure Loft knows about deploying the workloads into a separate cluster
        workloadVirtualClusterTemplateDefinition: {}
        # You can specify specific workload cluster helm values via
        # helmRelease:
        #   values: ...
    # This is the reference to the cluster where the control-plane is running
    clusterRef:
        namespace: vcluster-control-plane
        virtualCluster: my-vcluster
        cluster: cluster-1              # the k8s cluster where the vcluster control plane runs
    # This is the reference to the cluster where the workloads are running
    workloadClusterRef:
        namespace: vcluster-workloads
        virtualCluster: my-vcluster
        cluster: cluster-2              # the k8s cluster where the actual workloads run
```
