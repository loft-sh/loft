Apps in Loft are a way for admins to package applications and scripts in consumable packages.
These Apps can then be deployed into clusters, spaces, or virtual clusters. This section is
about using Apps in conjunction with spaces, to read more about Apps in general,
please see the full [Apps section](../apps/what-are-apps).

Spaces combined with Apps are a great way to create repeatable, pre-packaged
development, testing, or even production environments. Once an App has been created in the Loft
instance, it can be installed into any space -- either at time of creation, or into
existing spaces. This gives administrators the capability to create fully populated
development, test, or even production, environments in a single easy to manage package!

:::info Space Templates
Space templates can take this combination of spaces and apps to the next
level, by creating simple, reusable, version-able templates that define a reproducible
environment!

            <Step>
                From the drop down menu <Label>Add a new App ...</Label> select an App that you
                would like to be included as part of the template. You can select as many Apps
                as you would like here by simply selecting another App from the drop down menu.
                If you accidentally add one, or add one you do not want, click the trash icon
                next to the Apps name to remove it from the template.
            </Step>
            <Step>

space template itself!
