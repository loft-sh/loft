**Create Loft Config For OIDC**

Loft is able to use an OIDC provider as an authentication source.

To tell Loft to use OIDC for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml
auth:
 # Tell loft to allow OIDC for authentication
  oidc:
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # IssuerURL is the URL the provider signs ID Tokens as.
    issuerUrl: https://accounts.google.com 
    # ClientID the JWT must be issued for, the "sub" field. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret to issue tokens from the OIDC provider. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/oidc/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/oidc/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) Path to a PEM encoded root certificate of the provider. 
    caFile: /tmp/ca-file.crt
    # (Optional) Specify whether to communicate without validating SSL certificates
    insecureCa: false
    # (Optional) UsernameClaim is the JWT field to use as the user's username. 
    # If not set defaults to email.
    usernameClaim: email
    # (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to username to be prefix with
    # the provided value.  
    usernamePrefix: my-prefix-
    # (Optional) If specified, causes the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
    # groups with an ID Token field.
    groupsClaim: groups
    # (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to group names to be prefixed with the
    # value.
    groupsPrefix: group-prefix-
    # (Optional) If groups is non empty, access is denied if the user is not part of at least one 
    # of the specified groups. This requires groupsClaim to be set!
    groups: ["my-oidc-group"]
    # (Optional) If specified, tells the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
    # information from the UserInfo. This might be necessary for slim tokens such as used
    # by Okta
    getUserInfo: false
```

<Step>2</Step>

**Authenticate via OIDC**

After saving the new Loft configuration, Loft will restart itself and you should be able to log in via your OIDC provider.

**Disable Username + Password Authentication** (optional)
