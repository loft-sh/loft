A key aspect of Loft is establishing secure multi-tenancy when sharing clusters among multiple users and teams. To guarantee fair use for every tenant and to isolate tenants from each other, Loft provides two features:
- [Quotas](#quotas) which define aggregated resource limits for users and/or teams (e.g. max 5 spaces, max 12 GB memory)
- [Space Constraints](#space-constraints) which define resources and other configurations that will be enforced for each space a user or a team creates using Loft (e.g. required labels and annotations, or resources such as a NetworkPolicy or LimitRange in each namespace)


## Quotas

## Space Constraints
Space Constraints allow you to define restrictions for namespaces such as enforced resources that will be deployed to each new namespace a user creates (e.g. NetworkPolicies) or other enforced settings such as mandatory labels, annotations, or any sleep mode configurations.
