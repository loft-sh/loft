Loft provides the following GitHub Actions for use in workflows:
- [Setup DevSpace](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-devspace): Installs the `devspace` CLI
- [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft): Installs the `loft` CLI and logs in to the Loft instance
- [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space): Creates a Space
- [Delete Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-space): Deletes a Space
- [Create Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-vcluster): Creates a Virtual Cluster
- [Delete Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-vcluster): Deletes a Virtual Cluster

#### Spaces for Pull Requests

These examples show how to create and delete Spaces for pull requests.

    ]
    }>
<TabItem value="manual">

This example shows how to create and delete a space to test an application named `my-app` for pull requests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/prs.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Loft CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-loft@main
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          access-key: ${{ secrets.LOFT_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Create Space for PR
        uses: loft-sh/create-space@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status -n pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }} deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
      - name: Delete PR Space
        uses: loft-sh/delete-space@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space) action is used to create a unique space using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
6. Finally, the [Delete Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-space) GitHub Action is used to delete the pull request's space.

This example shows how to automatically delete a Space after testing an application named `my-app` for pull requests.

          auto-cleanup: true
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status -n pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }} deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space) action is used to create a unique space using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps. Additionally, we have enabled the `auto-cleanup` option, which will delete the space after the job completes.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Finally we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework. There's no need to delete the space since the `auto-cleanup` option was used when creating the space.
