Access keys let you authenticate with Loft API endpoints and Loft CLI in non-interactive environments such as from within CI/CD pipelines.


## Create Access Key

## Use Access Key

### Log in via CLI
You can use an access key to log into Loft from non-intercative environments:
```bash
loft login [domain] --access-key=[ACCESS_KEY]

# Retrieve kube-contexts afterward:
loft use space/vcluster/cluster [name]
```

### Kube-Context
You can use an access key to manually construct a valid kube-context for:
- [A Space](./endpoints/cluster.mdx)
- [A Virtual Cluster](./endpoints/virtual-cluster.mdx)
- [A Connected Cluster](./endpoints/cluster.mdx)
- [The Loft Management API](./endpoints/management.mdx)
