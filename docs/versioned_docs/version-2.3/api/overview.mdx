title: Loft API Endpoints
sidebar_label: Overview
---

The Loft API server provides multiple endpoints to communicate with. Depending on the endpoint, Loft will proxy the request either to its internal Kubernetes API server, to a connected Kubernetes cluster, to a virtual Kubernetes cluster or handle it internally.

The different endpoints can be reached by providing a prefix in front of the actual Kubernetes path (e.g. `https://my-loft-domain.com/$PREFIX/$KUBERNETES_PATH`). Based on this prefix, Loft will know how to route the request to the correct destination.

## Endpoints
There are several Kubernetes path prefixes for Loft that will target different Kubernetes API servers:
- **/kubernetes/management/**: Prefix that proxies the request to the internal Loft management Kubernetes API server.
- **/kubernetes/cluster/$CLUSTER/**: Prefix that proxies incoming Kubernetes requests to the connected cluster $CLUSTER.
- **/kubernetes/virtualcluster/$CLUSTER/$NAMESPACE/$VCLUSTER/**: Prefix that proxies incoming Kubernetes requests to the virtual cluster $VCLUSTER in namespace $NAMESPACE in the connected cluster $CLUSTER.

For example, if you would want to retrieve pods from a connected cluster `loft-cluster`, the corresponding Kubernetes URL would be `https://my-loft-domain/kubernetes/cluster/loft-cluster/api/v1/pods`. 

With that knowledge, you can also create a kube config to use `kubectl` to query that cluster directly through Loft (basically what `loft use cluster` is doing internally):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://my-loft-domain.com/kubernetes/cluster/loft-cluster
  name: loft_loft-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft_loft-cluster
    user: loft_loft-cluster
  name: loft_loft-cluster
current-context: loft_loft-cluster
users:
- name: loft_loft-cluster
  user:
    token: ACCESS_KEY
```

Other non kubernetes endpoints exposed by Loft:
- **/auth/**: Authentication endpoints that are used by the Loft UI to login a user
- **/oidc/**: Endpoint for the internal OIDC server. See [loft as OIDC provider](../admin/guides/oidc-provider.mdx) for more details.
- **/grafana/$CLUSTER/**: All requests to this endpoint will be proxied to the cluster's grafana instance (if there is any).
