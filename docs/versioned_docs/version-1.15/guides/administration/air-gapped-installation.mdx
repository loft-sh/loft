:::note About This Guide
**Goal**: Install Loft into an air-gapped kubernetes cluster  
**Estimated time**: 40 minutes  
**Requirements:**  
- a running air-gapped kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` (check via `kubectl version`)
- `helm` v3 (check with `helm version`)
- `docker` (check with `docker version`)
- a kube-context with admin access to this Kubernetes cluster (check with `kubectl auth can-i create clusterrole -A`)
- an offline license key for loft (contact info@loft.sh to get one)
- **Optionally**: a private docker registry that you and the kubernetes cluster can access (e.g. my-private-registry:5000 or gcr.io/my-team)
:::

## Optional: Download and push the needed docker images

If your cluster is not able to pull images from docker hub, you have to push the required docker images into a private registry.
To find out which images are needed we provide a file called `loft-images.txt` with each loft release.
Download the `loft-images.txt` from your chosen loft release on the [releases page](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases).

Next download the script `download-images.sh` from the [releases page](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases) and run it inside a folder with `loft-images.txt`:
```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x ./download-images.sh

# Download all required images and compress them
./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt
```

Please be patient since this process can take a while. After the command has finished a file called `loft-images.tar.gz` should have been created.
For the next step download the script `push-images.sh` from the [releases page](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases) and run it inside the same folder:
```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x ./push-images.sh

# Push all images to the private registry (make sure you are logged into the registry)
# You can also append a suffix to the registry e.g. gcr.io/my-team
./push-images.sh --registry my-private-registry:5000
```

After a while all images should be pushed and you can continue with the next step.

## Install loft into the cluster

The next step is to deploy loft via helm into the air-gapped cluster.

:::warning Open Ports in VPC Networks
Since loft and [kiosk](https://github.com/kiosk-sh/kiosk) install [webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) and [api server extensions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-extension-api-server/) into the cluster, the kubernetes master needs to be able to communicate with the loft and kiosk pods.
In private GKE clusters the kubernetes master and nodes for example are not in the same subnetwork and [cannot communicate directly](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules) with each other on every port.
Hence, you need to ensure that there is a firewall rule that allows incoming traffic from the kubernetes master network to the tcp ports:
- 8888 (loft api service extension)
- 8443 (loft agent api service extension)
- 9443 (loft agent webhook & loft webhook)
:::

Now use helm to install loft into the cluster:
<Tabs
    defaultValue="privateregistry"
    values={[
        { label: 'With Private Docker Registry', value: 'privateregistry', },
        { label: 'Without Private Docker Registry', value: 'noprivateregistry', },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="privateregistry">

```bash
# Put any loft version here that you want to install and pushed the images for
# Please strip the 'v' infront of the version (e.g. v1.0.0 is bad, 1.0.0 is good)
# Check https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases for the latest Loft release version
export VERSION=x.x.x
    
# The initial password for the admin user. You can login
# into loft via admin:PASSWORD
export PASSWORD=my-password

# The email that should be used for the admin user
export EMAIL=my-email@my-company.com

# The license key you have received from us
export LICENSE=LICENSE_KEY

# The registry you pushed the required images to.
# e.g. my-private-registry:5000 or gcr.io/my-team
export REGISTRY=my-private-registry:5000

# Run the helm command
helm install loft loft --repository-config '' \
   --repo https://charts.loft.sh \ 
   --version $VERSION \
   --set admin.password=$PASSWORD \
   --set admin.email=$EMAIL \
   --set image=$REGISTRY/loftsh/loft:$VERSION \
   --set env.LICENSE_KEY=$LICENSE \
   --set env.DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY=$REGISTRY \
   --namespace loft \
   --create-namespace
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="noprivateregistry">

```bash
# The initial password for the admin user. You can login
# into loft via admin:PASSWORD
export PASSWORD=my-password

# The email that should be used for the admin user
export EMAIL=my-email@my-company.com

# The license key you have received from us
export LICENSE=LICENSE_KEY

# Run the helm command
helm install loft loft --repository-config '' \
    --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
    --set admin.password=$PASSWORD \
    --set admin.email=$EMAIL \
    --set env.LICENSE_KEY=$LICENSE \
    --namespace loft \
    --create-namespace
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After a while the loft container and kiosk should be running:
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n loft
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
loft-agent-6cf658c9ff-sqcjg   1/1     Running   0          140s
loft-769d77774d-2ckh2         1/1     Running   0          184s
```

For testing purposes you can connect to loft directly via port-forwarding:
```bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/loft -n loft 8080:443
```

You then can reach loft under `https://localhost:8080` (Please make sure to accept any untrusted certificates).

## Upgrading loft

Upgrading loft basically follows the same principle as installing loft:
- **Optionally**: Download and push the required images for the version into the private registry
- Upgrade loft via helm:


<Tabs
    defaultValue="privateregistry"
    values={[
        { label: 'With Private Docker Registry', value: 'privateregistry', },
        { label: 'Without Private Docker Registry', value: 'noprivateregistry', },
    ]
    }>
<TabItem value="privateregistry">

```bash
# Put any loft version here that you want to upgrade and pushed the images for
# Please strip the 'v' infront of the version (e.g. v1.0.0 is bad, 1.0.0 is good)
export VERSION=x.x.x

# The registry you pushed the required images to.
# e.g. my-private-registry:5000 or gcr.io/my-team
export REGISTRY=my-private-registry:5000

# Run the helm command
helm upgrade loft loft --repository-config '' \
   --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
   --version $VERSION \
   --namespace loft \
   --reuse-values \
   --set image=$REGISTRY/loftsh/loft:$VERSION
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="noprivateregistry">

```bash
# Put any loft version here that you want to upgrade and pushed the images for
# Please strip the 'v' infront of the version (e.g. v1.0.0 is bad, 1.0.0 is good)
export VERSION=x.x.x

# Run the helm command
helm upgrade loft loft --repository-config '' \
    --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
    --version $VERSION \
    --namespace loft
```
