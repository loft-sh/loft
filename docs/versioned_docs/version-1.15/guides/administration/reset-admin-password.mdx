If you have lost the password for a loft user, you can also reset it via kubectl. Make sure you have cluster wide access to the kubernetes cluster where loft is running in. 

## Find the kubernetes secret with the password hash

In order to find the kubernetes secret where the password hash for a specific user is stored, run the following command:

```
$ kubectl get user admin -o yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: User
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  passwordRef:
    key: password
    secretName: loft-user-secret-admin
    secretNamespace: loft
...
```

The important part of the yaml is the password ref, which holds the reference for the secret where the password is stored.

## Reset the password

The next step is to create a sha256 hash of your new password:

```
echo -n my-new-password | sha256sum
```

which should print something like:

```
d7ff0c3cf3be79e0ecd30971c163b6be693fcb26578f18f1b9a3926eaf7b339d  -
```

Now copy the hash (`d7ff0c3cf3be79e0ecd30971c163b6be693fcb26578f18f1b9a3926eaf7b339d`) without the `-` and patch the secret with the new password hash:

```
kubectl get secret loft-user-secret-admin -n loft -o json | jq --arg password "$(echo d7ff0c3cf3be79e0ecd30971c163b6be693fcb26578f18f1b9a3926eaf7b339d | base64)" '.data["password"]=$password' | kubectl apply -f -
```

After that you should be able to login with the user `admin` and your new password into loft.
