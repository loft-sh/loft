When using Loft in a CI/CD pipeline to create namespaces and virtual cluster, there are couple of things to consider:
1. You might want to generate your kube configs manually
2. You may want to use the [offical `loftsh/loft-ci` image](#using-the-container-image) in a containerized CI/CD pipeline
3. You definitely want to [authenticate using Access Keys](#authentication) in either case
4. If using GitHub Actions for CI/CD see the section on [Using GitHub Actions](#github-actions)
5. If using GitLab for CI/CD  see [Using GitLab CI/CD Pipelines](#gitlab-cicd)

## Authentication & Cluster Access

You can easily construct a kube config that can be used directly in any external CI/CD pipeline or tool to access a space, connected cluster or vcluster directly. For this you'll only need an [access key](#authentication).

Then you can create a kube config in this format:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="space"
    values={[
        { label: 'Space', value: 'space', },
        { label: 'Cluster', value: 'cluster', },
        { label: 'vcluster', value: 'vcluster', },
    ]
    }>
<TabItem value="space">

Create a `kubeconfig.yaml` with:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:    
    # Optional if untrusted certificate
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://my-loft-domain.com/kubernetes/cluster/$CLUSTER
  name: loft
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft
    namespace: $SPACE
    user: loft
  name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
- name: loft
  user:
    token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

Replace the $ACCESS_KEY with your generated access key, $CLUSTER with the name of the connected kubernetes cluster the space was created in and $SPACE with the name of the space. You can now use this kube config with any external applications such as `kubectl` or `terraform`.

Then run any command in the space with:
```
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml get pods
```
    
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cluster">

Create a `kubeconfig.yaml` with:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:    
    # Optional if untrusted certificate
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://my-loft-domain.com/kubernetes/cluster/$CLUSTER
  name: loft
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft
    user: loft
  name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
- name: loft
  user:
    token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

Replace the $ACCESS_KEY with your generated access key and $CLUSTER with the name of the connected kubernetes cluster. You can now use this kube config with any external applications such as `kubectl` or `terraform`.

Then run any command in the cluster with:
```
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml get spaces
```
    
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vcluster">

Create a `kubeconfig.yaml` with:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:    
    # Optional if untrusted certificate
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://my-loft-domain.com/kubernetes/virtualcluster/$CLUSTER/$NAMESPACE/$VCLUSTER
  name: loft
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft
    user: loft
  name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
- name: loft
  user:
    token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

Replace the $ACCESS_KEY with your generated access key, $CLUSTER with the name of the connected kubernetes cluster the vcluster is running in, $NAMESPACE with the namespace the vcluster is running in and $VCLUSTER with the name of the vcluster. You can now use this kube config with any external applications such as `kubectl` or `terraform`.

Then run any command in the vcluster with:
```
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml get ns
```

:::info RBAC Permissions
In order for a user to access a virtual cluster the user needs the RBAC permission `get` on the resource `virtualclusters` in the api group `storage.loft.sh` with api version `v1` either in the namespace where the virtual cluster was created in or cluster wide

## Authentication

### Create Access Keys

<CreateAccessKeysFragment/>

## Using the Container Image
When using Loft in a CI/CD pipeline that runs based on containers, you can use the [official `loft-ci` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/loftsh/loft-ci) either as a base image or directly.

This image is based on `alpine` and contains:
- [Loft CLI](https://github.com/loft-sh/loftctl)
- kubectl
- helm v3
- [DevSpace](https://devspace.sh/)

This is what the Dockerfile looks like:

```Dockerfile
FROM devspacesh/devspace:5

# Add helm
RUN wget -O helm.tar.gz https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.3.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz \
 && tar -zxvf helm.tar.gz \
 && mv linux-amd64/helm /bin/helm

# Add Loft CLI (same version as the tag of this image)
COPY release/loft-linux-amd64 /bin/loft
RUN chmod +x /bin/loft
```

### Login with Access Keys

## Integrations

### GitHub Actions

Loft provides the following GitHub Actions for use in workflows:
- [Setup DevSpace](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-devspace): Installs the `devspace` CLI
- [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft): Installs the `loft` CLI and logs in to the Loft instance
- [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space): Creates a Space
- [Delete Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-space): Deletes a Space
- [Create Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-vcluster): Creates a Virtual Cluster
- [Delete Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-vcluster): Deletes a Virtual Cluster

#### Spaces for Pull Requests

These examples show how to create and delete Spaces for pull requests.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="manual"
    values={[
        { label: 'Basic', value: 'manual', },
        { label: 'Automatic Cleanup', value: 'automatic', },
        { label: 'DevSpace', value: 'devspace', },
    ]
    }>
<TabItem value="manual">

This example shows how to create and delete a space to test an application named `my-app` for pull requests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/prs.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Loft CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-loft@main
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          access-key: ${{ secrets.LOFT_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Create Space for PR
        uses: loft-sh/create-space@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status -n pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }} deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
      - name: Delete PR Space
        uses: loft-sh/delete-space@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space) action is used to create a unique space using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
6. Finally, the [Delete Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/delete-space) GitHub Action is used to delete the pull request's space.

      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space) action is used to create a unique space using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps. Additionally, we have enabled the `auto-cleanup` option, which will delete the space after the job completes.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Finally we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework. There's no need to delete the space since the `auto-cleanup` option was used when creating the space.

          auto-cleanup: true
      - name: Run Tests
        run: devspace run e2e
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup DevSpace](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-devspace) action installs the DevSpace CLI.
2. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the Loft CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
3. The [Create Space](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-space) action is used to create a unique space using information about the pull request. This will automatically configure the kube context for the following steps. Additionally, we have enabled the `auto-cleanup` option, which will delete the space after the job completes.

### GitLab CI/CD

When using Loft with GitLab you can use the [official `loft-ci` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/loftsh/loft-ci) as either a base image or directly. See [Using the Container Image](#using-the-container-image) for details on the available tools. If additional tooling is needed for your CI/CD process, a custom image can be created.

#### Spaces for Merge Requests

This example shows how to create and delete a Space for running end-to-end tests for the default branch and merge requests. It assumes you have configured CI/CD variables `LOFT_URL` and `LOFT_ACCESS_KEY`.

```yaml {}
image: loftsh/loft-ci

stages:
  - test

e2e:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - loft login $LOFT_URL --access-key $LOFT_ACCESS_KEY
    - loft create space "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}"
    - apk add go make
  script:
    - kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
    - kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
    - make e2e
  after_script:
    - loft delete space "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}"

```

**Explanation:**
1. The `loftsh/loft-ci` image is used for all pipeline jobs and provides the `loft` CLI, the `devspace` CLI, and `kubectl`.
2. The `before_script` first logs in to loft using the `$LOFT_URL` and `$LOFT_ACCESS_KEY` variables that you defined in GitLab. [See the GitLab docs for more information](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
3. The `before_script` then creates a space using [predefined GitLab variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) to create a unique name for the space.
4. Next `before_script` installs some additional tooling needed to run the end-to-end tests. For more complex scenarios creating a custom image is recommended.
5. Then the `script` section uses `kubectl` to deploy the application to the space and waits for the `my-app` deployment to become ready. `make` is then used to run an end-to-end test suite.
6. Finally `after_script` deletes the space. By using `after_script` we can ensure the space is deleted even if the tests fail.

#### Virtual Clusters for Merge Requests

This example shows how to create and delete a Virtual Cluster for running end-to-end tests for the default branch and merge requests. It assumes you have configured CI/CD variables `LOFT_URL` and `LOFT_ACCESS_KEY`.

    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - loft login $LOFT_URL --access-key $LOFT_ACCESS_KEY
    - loft create vcluster "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}"
    - apk add go make
  script:
    - kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
    - kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
    - make e2e
  after_script:
    - loft delete vcluster "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}" --delete-space

```

**Explanation:**
1. The `loftsh/loft-ci` image is used for all pipeline jobs and provides the `loft` CLI, the `devspace` CLI, and `kubectl`.
2. The `before_script` first logs in to loft using the `$LOFT_URL` and `$LOFT_ACCESS_KEY` variables that you defined in GitLab. [See the GitLab docs for more information](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
3. The `before_script` then creates a virtual cluster using [predefined GitLab variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) to create a unique name.
4. Next `before_script` installs some additional tooling needed to run the end-to-end tests. For more complex scenarios creating a custom image is recommended.
5. Then the `script` section uses `kubectl` to deploy the application to the space and waits for the `my-app` deployment to become ready. `make` is then used to run an end-to-end test suite.
6. Finally `after_script` deletes the virtual cluster, and passes `--delete-space` to ensure the corresponding space for the cluster is deleted. By using `after_script` we can ensure the space is deleted even if the tests fail.
