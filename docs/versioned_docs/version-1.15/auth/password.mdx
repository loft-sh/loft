When using password-based authentication, you have to manually add users either via the UI or via kubectl.

<CreateUserFragment/>

## Disable Password Auth
Authentication with username and password is enabled by default but you can also disable password-based authentication if you want to force users to use single sign-on (SSO).

<DisablePasswordAuthFragment/>
