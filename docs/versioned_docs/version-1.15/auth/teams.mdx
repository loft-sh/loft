:::warning Data Loss
Deleting a team will also delete all cluster accounts that are owned solely by this team. [Deleting these accounts in turn will also delete other related objects](../multi-tenancy/accounts.mdx#delete-accounts) such as account quotas and spaces.

## Image Pull Secrets

Image pull secrets can be used to automatically login users that are part of a team to specified container image registries as soon as they run `loft login` (no locally installed docker needed).
