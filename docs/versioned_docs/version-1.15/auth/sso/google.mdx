<Step>1</Step>

**Create Loft Config For Google**

Loft is able to use Googleâ€™s OpenID Connect provider as an authentication source. 

To tell Loft to use Google for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml
auth:
  # Tell loft to use google authentication
  google:    
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID for the google authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret for the google authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/google/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/google/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) defaults to "profile" and "email"
    scopes: ["profile", "email"]
    # (Optional) list of whitelisted domains. If this field is nonempty, 
	# only users from a listed domain will be allowed to log in
	hostedDomains: []
	# (Optional) list of whitelisted groups. If this field is nonempty, 
	# only users from a listed group will be allowed to log in
	groups: []
	# (Optional) path to service account json. If nonempty, 
	# and groups claim is made, will use authentication from file to
	# check groups with the admin directory api
	serviceAccountFilePath: /path/to/service/account.json
	# (Optional) Required if serviceAccountFilePath is set. The email of
	# a GSuite super user which the service account will impersonate
	# when listing groups
	adminEmail: myuser@mydomain.com
    # (Optional) Cluster Account Templates that will be automatically added for new users 
	# logging in through this authentication
	clusterAccountTemplates: 
	  # The name of the cluster account template
	- name: my-cluster-account-template
      sync: true
	# (Optional) A mapping between groups and cluster account templates. 
	# If the user has a certain group, the cluster account template 
	# will be added during creation
	groupClusterAccountTemplates:
	  # Name of the group from the token
	  - group: my-group
	    # Names of the cluster account templates to apply
	    clusterAccountTemplates: 
	    - name: my-cluster-account-template
          sync: true
```
