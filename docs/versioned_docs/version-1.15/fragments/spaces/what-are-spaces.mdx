Spaces are virtual objects which represent namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster. The advantage of letting engineers work with spaces is that you can give them the permission to list/get/create/delete **spaces** without having to give them the permission to list/get/create/delete **namespaces**. 

While engineers work with spaces, Loft handles the underlying operations on the actual namespaces and enforces the restrictions that admins define for users, e.g. limting the number of spaces/namespaces.
