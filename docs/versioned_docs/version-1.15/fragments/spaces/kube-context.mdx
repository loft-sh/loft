:::info How does it work?
To provide access to a space/namespace, Loft creates a new RBAC role binding for the Loft user. This is done in a way that this user can only access objects within this and other namespaces the user has access to. Then, Loft generates a kube-context using an [access key](../../auth/access-keys.mdx) and adds it to the `~/.kube/config` file on the user's computer.
