<Step>1</Step>

**Create A GitLab App**

In GitLab, navigate to `User Settings > Applications` and create a new application with the following settings:
- Application name: Loft Login via GitLab
- Redirect URI: https://loft.yourcompany.tld/auth/gitlab/callback = `https:// + $LOFT_HOSTNAME + /auth/gitlab/callback`
- Scopes: `read_user` + `openid`

Remember the `$GITLAB_CLIENT_ID` and `$GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET` that GitLab generates for your OAuth application because you will need it in the next step.

<Step>2</Step>

**Create Loft Config For GitLab**

To tell Loft to use gitlab for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:
```yaml
auth:
  # Tell loft to use gitlab authentication
  gitlab:
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID for the gitlab authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret for the gitlab authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/gitlab/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/gitlab/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) BaseURL of the gitlab instance, 
    # default = https://gitlab.com
    baseURL: https://my-gitlab-instance.com
    # (Optional) Optional groups whitelist, communicated through the "groups" scope.
	# If groups is omitted, all of the user's GitLab groups are returned.
	# If groups is provided, this acts as a whitelist - only the user's GitLab 
	# groups that are in the configured groups below will go into the groups claim. 
	# Conversely, if the user is not in any of the configured groups, the user will
	# not be authenticated.
	groups:
	- my-group
    # (Optional) Cluster Account Templates that will be automatically added for new users 
	# logging in through this authentication
	clusterAccountTemplates: 
	  # The name of the cluster account template
	- name: my-cluster-account-template
      sync: true
	# (Optional) A mapping between groups and cluster account templates. 
	# If the user has a certain group, the cluster account template 
	# will be added during creation
	groupClusterAccountTemplates:
	  # Name of the group from the token
	  - group: my-group
	    # Names of the cluster account templates to apply
	    clusterAccountTemplates: 
	    - name: my-cluster-account-template
          sync: true
```

<Step>3</Step>

**Authenticate via GitLab**

After saving the new Loft configuration, Loft will restart itself and you should be able to log in via GitLab.

<Step>4</Step>

**Disable Username + Password Authentication** (optional)
