Enter a name for your cluster. This name must be a Kubernetes-compatible object name, i.e. only lowercase characters and dashes are allowed.

:::note Naming
Cluster names should tell engineers what the cluster is used for and where it is located, e.g. `gke-prod`, `gke-dev-tpu-us-1`, `eks-dev-us-west-1`
