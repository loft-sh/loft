To give Loft access to a cluster, you need to provide a kube-config for this cluster.

**Option A:** To automatically create a kube-config using [Loft CLI](../../getting-started/setup.mdx#1-download-loft-cli), run the following command:
```bash
loft generate admin-kube-config
```
:::caution
Make sure you are in the right cluster/context before executing the command shown above.

:::caution
If you try to connect a Rancher provisioned cluster, please make sure you are using the [Authorized Cluster Endpoint](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/cluster-access/ace/) for the cluster you wish to connect. Otherwise, you'll experience problems with authentication as the default Rancher proxy authentication endpoint does not correctly support impersonation.
:::

**Option B:** To manually create a kube-config, you need to:
1. Create a ServiceAccount
2. Create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the ServiceAccount to the ClusterRole `cluster-admin`
3. Create a kube-config for the cluster using the token of the ServiceAccount created above
