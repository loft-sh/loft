Creating a shared image pull secret is very similar to [creating an image pull secret in kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) itself:

On your computer, you must authenticate with a registry in order to grant other users or teams access to it:

```
docker login [optional-docker-registry]
```

When prompted, enter your Docker username and password.

The login process creates or updates a `config.json` file that holds an authorization token.

View the `config.json` file:

```
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```

The output contains a section similar to this:

```yaml
{
    "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
            "auth": "c3R...zE2"
        }
    }
}
```

:::info
Note: If you use a Docker credentials store, you won't see that auth entry but a credsStore entry with the name of the store as value.
:::

With that information you can create a shared loft secret.

<figure class="frame">
    <img src="/docs/media/v1/ui/secrets/image-pull-secret.png" alt="Create Secret" />
    <figcaption>Create a shared secret with docker credentials</figcaption>
</figure>

:::info
Note: The actual name of the shared secret or key name do not matter and can be chosen freely.
:::

Next, you can configure a user or team to use that image pull secret, by editing the `Image Pull Secrets` section of the user or team.

<figure class="frame">
    <img src="/docs/media/v1/ui/secrets/image-pull-secret-user.png" alt="Assign Secret" />
    <figcaption>Assign the shared secret to an user</figcaption>
</figure>

Then press 'Update'. If the user will now login, he will also login into the specified container registry:

```
$ loft login loft.my-company.tld
[info]   If the browser does not open automatically, please navigate to https://loft.my-company.tld/login?cli=true
[done] √ Successfully logged into loft at https://loft.my-company.tld
[done] √ Successfully logged into docker registry 'docker hub'
```

:::warning User or Team need view access
In order for the user to login with an image pull secret, the user or the team need to have access to view the shared secret, otherwise they will not be able to login into the container registry. You can change the access to a shared secret in the `Secrets > YOUR-SECRET > Access` tab.
