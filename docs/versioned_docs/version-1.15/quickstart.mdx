:::note About This Guide
**Goal**: Install Loft to Kubernetes, evaluate the core features, and decide if Loft is what your team needs  
**Estimated time**: 5 minutes  
**Requirements:**
- any local or remote Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, Docker Desktop, GKE, EKS, AKS, Rancher, ...). Allocate at least 4 GB of memory for single node clusters like Docker Desktop and minikube.
- `kubectl` (check via `kubectl version`)
- `helm` v3 (check with `helm version`)
- a kube-context with admin access to this Kubernetes cluster (check with `kubectl auth can-i create clusterrole -A`)
:::

## 1. Download Loft CLI
Use one of the following commands to download the Loft CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLIFragment/>


## 2. Deploy Loft + Login
Ensure that you are in the correct kube-context and then run this command:
```bash
loft start
```

:::caution Choose Port Forwarding
When Loft CLI asks you how you `How do you want to access loft?`, answer with `via port-forwarding`. We will see later how you can connect a domain and configure SSL.
:::

The output of `loft start` will look like this:
```text {7-8,17-24}
[info]   Welcome to the Loft installation.
[info]   This installer will guide you through the installation.

? Seems like your cluster is running locally (Docker Desktop, minikube, etc). Is that correct?
  > Yes

? How do you want to access Loft?
  > via port-forwarding (only you can access Loft)

? Enter an email address for your admin user: admin@example.com

[info]   Executing command: helm install loft -n loft ...
[done] √ Successfully deployed Loft to your kubernetes cluster!
[done] √ Loft pod has successfully started

##########################   LOGIN   ############################
Username: admin
Password: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX        <-- COPY THIS, YOU WILL NEED IT IN THE NEXT STEP

Login via UI:  https://localhost:9898
Login via CLI: loft login --insecure https://localhost:9898

!!! You must accept the untrusted certificate in your browser !!!
Follow this guide to add a valid certificate: https://loft.sh/docs/administration/ssl
#################################################################

Loft was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://localhost:9898
Thanks for using loft!
```

:::info Re-Run `loft start`
You may re-run `loft start` and it will automatically detect that Loft has already been deployed and just start port forwarding again.
:::

After Loft has been deployed and port forwarding has been started, open a second terminal window and run the following command to log in to your Loft instance:
```bash
loft login --insecure https://localhost:9898
```

The CLI will then open the browser, so you can log in with the admin password shown in the output of `loft start` (see step 2 above).

After you logged in via the UI, you will also be logged in via the CLI because you started the login process via `loft login`.


## 3. Main Features

### 3.1 Spaces
Spaces in Loft are the equivalent of regular Kubernetes namespaces with the difference that users can create spaces without having to be cluster admin. 

<Tabs
  defaultValue="create"
  values={[
    { label: 'Create Spaces', value: 'create', },
    { label: 'Delete Spaces', value: 'delete', },
    { label: 'List Spaces', value: 'list', },
    { label: 'Use Spaces', value: 'use', },
    { label: 'Inspect Spaces', value: 'inspect', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="create">

While users will be able to create spaces via the UI, it is much easier to create them via the CLI:
```bash
loft create space my-microservice-1
```

:::info Kube-Context
Because this command adds a kube-context to the local kube-config file for this space, the user will now be able to immediately use this namespace with any tool that is working with the current kube-context. 
:::

Here are just a few example commands of what a user could do with their space:
```bash
kubectl get pods  # use regular kubectl (no --namespace flag needed)
helm install ...  # install helm charts to the namespace
skaffold run      # deploy something with skaffold
devspace dev      # start development with DevSpace
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="delete">

Users will also be able to delete spaces but only the ones that they own:
```bash
loft delete space my-microservice-1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="list">

Although non-admin users will typically not be able to list all namespaces in a cluster, they can list spaces because they are "virtual" objects and listing spaces filters and only shows those namespaces that the user has the RBAC permission to create objects in.
```bash
loft list spaces
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="use">

Users can have multiple spaces and switch between them. Try it:
```bash
loft create space my-microservice-2   # we are not working in this new namespace now
loft use space my-microservice-1      # switch back to the kube-context of the first namespace
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="inspect">

While users can use `kubectl` or any localhost UI (e.g. [Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens)) to explore what is running in their spaces, Loft also lets users take a quick look inside their spaces using the Loft UI.

### 3.2 Virtual Clusters

#### What are virtual clusters?
- Fully functional Kubernetes clusters (run with the certified Kubernetes distribution k3s)
- Run inside a single namespace of another Kubernetes cluster
- Very lightweight and start within a few seconds (much faster than regular EKS/GKE clusters)
- Much cheaper than "real" Kubernetes clusters (no extra cost for API server + sleep mode, see below)


#### How to work with virtual clusters?
Using virtual clusters is very similar to using spaces:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="create"
  values={[
    { label: 'Create Virtual Clusters', value: 'create', },
    { label: 'Delete Virtual Clusters', value: 'delete', },
    { label: 'List Virtual Clusters', value: 'list', },
    { label: 'Use Virtual Clusters', value: 'use', },
    { label: 'Inspect Virtual Clusters', value: 'inspect', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="create">

While users will be able to create Virtual Clusters via the UI, it is much easier to create them via the CLI:
```bash
loft create vcluster my-dev-stack-1
```

:::info Kube-Context
Because this command adds a kube-context to the local kube-config file for this virtual cluster, the user will now be able to use the virtual cluster with any tool that is working with the current kube-context. 
:::

Here are just a few example commands of what a user could do with this virtual cluster:
```bash
kubectl get namespaces            # list namespaces of the virtual cluster with kubectl
kubectl create namespace backend  # create a namespace `backend`
kubectl get pods -n kube-system   # list 
```

:::note Virtual Cluster Admin
Especially looking at the last example command above, you can see that the user really is admin of this virtual cluster. Although the user only has very restricted access to a single namespace of the host cluster, the user is admin of the virtual cluster that runs inside this namespace of the host cluster.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="delete">

Users will also be able to delete virtual cluster but only the ones that they own:
```bash
loft delete vcluster my-dev-stack-1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="list">

Users can also create multiple virtual clusters (e.g. for different microservices that they are working on). To get a list of all their virtual clusters, they can run:
```bash
loft list vclusters
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="use">

Users can have multiple virtual clusters and switch between them. Try it:
```bash
loft create vcluster my-dev-stack-2   # we are not working in this new virtual cluster now
loft use vcluster my-dev-stack-1      # switch back to the kube-context of the first virtual cluster
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="inspect">

While users can use `kubectl` or any localhost UI (e.g. [Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens)) to explore what is running in their virtual clusters, Loft also lets users take a quick look inside their virtual clusters using the Loft UI.

  </video>
  <figcaption>Loft UI - Inspect Virtual Clusters</figcaption>
</figure>

:::note Cross-Namespace Views
All virtual cluster inspection views you can see in the Loft UI are essentially using the `kubectl --all-namespaces` flag because virtual clusters tend to have a much smaller amount of namespaces and resources than regular clusters, so it is very fast to show all resources across all namespaces.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Why virtual clusters?
Sometimes, your engineers may need more than just namespaces, e.g. when:
- they need to deploy Helm charts that configure RBAC
- they deploy applications to multiple namespaces (e.g. database is supposed to run in a different namespace)
- they want to install something that needs to add Custom Resource Definitions

In such cases, users can create virtual clusters instead of spaces/namespaces. Learn more about [virtual Kubernetes clusters](https://loft.sh/blog/introduction-into-virtual-clusters-in-kubernetes/).


### 3.3 Sleep Mode + Auto-Delete
Loft automatically tracks idle namespaces and lets you configure if they should either be put to sleep or be automatically deleted after a certain period of inactivity.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="sleep-cli"
  values={[
    { label: 'Sleep', value: 'sleep-cli', },
    { label: 'Wake-up', value: 'wakeup-cli', },
    { label: 'Using UI', value: 'sleep-ui', },
    { label: 'Automatic', value: 'automatic', },
    { label: 'Automatic For All Spaces', value: 'automatic-all', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sleep-cli">

Run this command to manually put a space to sleep:
```bash
loft sleep [SPACE_NAME]   # optional flag: --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME]
```

<EditNamespacePermissionHint/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wakeup-cli">

You can always wake up a space by running a kubectl command:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Make sure you are in the context of this space (using the correct namespace)
kubectl get po
```

Instead of running a kubectl command, you can also run this command to manually wake up a space:
```bash
loft wakeup [SPACE_NAME]   # optional flag: --cluster=[CLUSTER_NAME]
```

<EditNamespacePermissionHint/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sleep-ui">

<figure class="frame">
  <video controls loop autoplay="true" muted>
    <source src="/docs/media/v1/ui/sleep-mode/manual.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>Loft UI - Manual Sleep &amp; Wake-Up</figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="automatic">

While triggering sleep mode manually is great, you can also configure that a certain namespace goes to sleep automatically after a certain period of inactivity.

<figure class="frame">
  <video controls loop autoplay="true" muted>
    <source src="/docs/media/v1/ui/sleep-mode/automatic-space.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>Loft UI - Change Sleep Mode For Space</figcaption>
</figure>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="automatic-all">

While automating sleep mode for single spaces is great, you can also automate things even further and configure that all namespaces of a certain user or team go to sleep automatically after a certain period of inactivity. Additionally, you can configure that spaces will be deleted after a certain period of inactivity.

## 4. Give Your Team Access
The features you have seen in this quickstart guide are great, but the idea of Loft is **not** that you as an admin are going to use them, instead the idea is to let your engineers use these features to get self-service access to Kubernetes. With Loft, you can add a pool of clusters and then give engineers access to these clusters.

<ClusterAccountDiagram/>

Loft provides a lot of powerful team features that will make it easy for you to set up a Kubernetes self-service platform for your team:
- Integration with Authentication Providers (LDAP, SAML, GitHub, GitLab, Micrsoft, Google, ...)
- Multi-Cluster Access Management & Secure Multi-Tenancy
- Automatic Tenant and Namespace Isolation via Security Templates
- Namespace-Based Kube-Context Management (as seen in the examples above)
