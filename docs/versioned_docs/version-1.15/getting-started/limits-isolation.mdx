There are 3 concepts in Loft that allow you to restrict or limit a user's account within a cluster:
- **Account Quotas** define resource limits for an account across all namespaces of an account within a cluster[^1]
- **Space Creation Settings** define max number of namespaces a user can create, sleep mode and other options
- **Templates** which can be enforced when creating a namespace (e.g. NetworkPolicies, LimitRanges etc.)

<span id="fn-1"><sup>1</sup> Think of a Kubernetes ResourceQuota but aggregated across namespaces of an account.</span>


## Create Account Quotas

## Space Limit & Metadata
While account quotas are mainly concerning resources that users are creating inside their spaces, you can also restrict the creation of spaces itself.

## Templates
Templates define Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts that you want to deploy to every namespace that a user creates when using their cluster account. This allows you to isolate namespaces and enforce security policies for each namespace.

## Additional Security
While Templates are great for namespace-level enforcement of security policies, it is stongly recommended to add cluster-wide security resources as well.

One example of such a security resource would be a `PodSecurityPolicy` that should be added to each connected cluster. You can use the following example to get started:
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: strict-policy
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostPorts:
  - max: 0
    min: 0
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - secret
  - configMap
  - emptyDir
  - downwardAPI
  - persistentVolumeClaim
```
