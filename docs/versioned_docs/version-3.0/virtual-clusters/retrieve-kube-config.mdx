To "use" a virtual cluster, as in connect to the virtual cluster Kubernetes API server, you can
manually construct a kube config or use the Loft CLI to automatically create and update your
kube config.


## Retrieve via CLI

The easiest way to retrieve a kube config for your virtual cluster is by using the Loft CLI.

You can update your current kube-config by running the following command:
```bash
loft use vcluster my-vcluster --project my-project
```

If you want to print the kube config, you can run this command instead:
```bash
loft use vcluster my-vcluster --project my-project --print
```

:::info
Depending on if you have direct [cluster endpoints](../clusters/direct-cluster-endpoints) or
[ingress endpoints for virtual clusters](../virtual-clusters/ingress-access)
enabled, the resulting kube config will look different

## Kube Config Without CLI

You can also create the kube config manually by creating an [access key](../users/access-keys) for
your user first and then using the following template, with the following placeholders:

* **$PROJECT**: the project the virtual cluster is in
* **$VIRTUAL_CLUSTER**: the virtual cluster name to connect to
* **$LOFT_HOST**: the loft host you connect to
* **$ACCESS_KEY**: the access key to use

Then replace these placeholders in the following template and save it as `my-kube-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://$LOFT_URL/kubernetes/project/$PROJECT/virtualcluster/$VIRTUAL_CLUSTER
    # Optional: if the server uses an insecure certificate
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
  name: loft
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft
    user: loft
  name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
- name: loft
  user:
    token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

You can then access your virtual cluster by using the freshly created kube config file:
```bash
KUBECONFIG=my-kube-config.yaml kubectl get namespaces
```
