Apps can be <i>versioned</i>. Versioning an App allows you to make changes over time to an App
while retaining the current version/iteration. Apps that are deployed from a template with
updated versions will show up with a warning indicating that a newer App version is available.

### Creating a New App Version

You can add new versions to your App via the Loft UI.

<Flow id="create-app-version">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Templates</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the Apps option on the templates pane.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Find the App you would like to add a new version to in the list of Apps. Click the small
        drop down button next to the name of your desired App. From the drop down menu, click
        the <Label>Add A New Version</Label> button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the pop up box, enter the new version string for your App. Once done, click the
        <Button>Add New Version</Button>.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, make any modifications desired for your new
        App version.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Save Changes</Button> button.
    </Step>
</Flow>

:::info Semantic Versioning
While not strictly mandatory, you should follow standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)
practices for your App versioning. Loft refers to the version numbers provided when determining
whether to indicate if an App (or space/virtual cluster template) has a newer version available.

### Updating An Installed App's Version

You can change the version of an installed App in a space, cluster, or virtual cluster to a
newer (or older!) version in the Loft UI.

    values={[
        {label: '(Physical) Cluster', value: 'cluster'},
        {label: 'Space', value: 'space'},
        {label: 'Virtual Cluster', value: 'vcluster'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="cluster">
