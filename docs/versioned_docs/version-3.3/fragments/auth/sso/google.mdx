**Create Loft Config For Google**

Loft is able to use Googleâ€™s OpenID Connect provider as an authentication source.

To tell Loft to use Google for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in Loft and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml
auth:
  # Tell loft to use google authentication
  google:    
    # 
    # 
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID for the google authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret for the google authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/google/callback
    redirectURI: https://loft.my.domain/auth/google/callback
    # 
    # 
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) defaults to "profile" and "email"
    scopes: ["profile", "email"]
    # (Optional) list of whitelisted domains. If this field is nonempty, 
    # only users from a listed domain will be allowed to log in
    hostedDomains: []
    # (Optional) list of whitelisted groups. If this field is nonempty, 
    # only users from a listed group will be allowed to log in
    groups: []
    # (Optional) path to service account json. If nonempty, 
    # and groups claim is made, will use authentication from file to
    # check groups with the admin directory api
    serviceAccountFilePath: /path/to/service/account.json
    # (Optional) Required if serviceAccountFilePath is set. The email of
    # a GSuite super user which the service account will impersonate
    # when listing groups

```
