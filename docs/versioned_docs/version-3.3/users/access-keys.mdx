Access Keys in Loft are used for authentication to Loft via the Loft CLI, or by any HTTP
utilities (i.e. curl). Access Keys can be generated by any Loft user, the generated Access Key
will provide the key's user with the same permissions as the user who generated the key.

Access Keys may optionally be scoped, that is, have their access limited to a particular cluster,
and within that cluster particular namespace(s) or virtual clusters. This is a great option to
use for keys generated for automated processes such as a CI pipeline.

## Create an Access Key

<Flow id="create-access-key">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <NavStep>Users</NavStep> button on the User Management screen.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Find the user you would like to generate an Access Key for from the list of
        users. Click the user.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the User Access Key management screen click the <Button>Create Access Key</Button>
        button.
    </Step>

        <Label>Enter a display name for this access key</Label> box.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <b>Optional</b> If you'd like to limit the scope of the Access Key, expand the
        <Label>Limit Access Key Scope</Label> configuration section. In this section you can
        select the cluster(s), namespace(s), and virtual clusters of which to limit the Access
        Key scope to.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create</Button> button.
    </Step>
