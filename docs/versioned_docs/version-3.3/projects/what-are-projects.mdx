Projects are the highest level organizational unit in Loft. In the simplest form, projects can be thought of as
containers for virtual resources (spaces and virtual clusters), however, they also play an important role in
enforcing role based access and quotas within Loft.

### Members

Perhaps the most important aspect of projects is that they contain members, that is, users and teams that are a part
of the given project. Only users and teams that are part of the project (and Loft admins) will have access to the
project. Moreover, each user or team can be given specific roles that define their role, and access, within the
project. See the [Members](members) section for more information.

### Templates

Projects contain a list of allowed templates that can be used by members to create space instances and virtual
cluster instances. Administrators can configure default templates, or simply allow all templates for the project.
See the [Templates](templates) section for more information.

### Allowed Clusters

Each project may define specific clusters that members of the project have access to. The member users and teams
will have their roles propagated to each allowed cluster. See the [Clusters](clusters) section for more information.

### Argo CD Integration

To help in managing Virtual Clusters, Loft Projects also integrate with Argo CD. Using the integration you can
configure Loft as a Single Sign On (SSO) provider for Argo CD. Users will then be able to log in to Argo CD. As
Virtual Clusters are added to the Project they can be registered as a destination for Argo CD
Apps to be installed. Read more about the Argo CD integration [here](argocd).
