Using Loft CLI is the preferred way to deploy Loft to a Kubernetes cluster. If you decide later
on you want to manage your Loft instance via GitOps, you may export the applied Kubernetes
manifests or Helm chart configuration and store this data in a git repository.


## 1. Download and Install Loft CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the Loft CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLIPartial/>


## 2. Deploy Loft

Make sure you are using the correct kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:

```bash
loft start
```

The CLI will ask for your email address to create the admin user and then deploy Loft to your
cluster.

:::tip Troubleshooting
Your Loft pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up? View our
**[Troubleshooting Guide](../getting-started/troubleshooting)** if you have any
issues.

:::warning Open Ports in VPC Networks
Since loft installs webhooks and api server extensions into the cluster, the kubernetes master needs to be able to communicate with the loft pod. In private GKE clusters the kubernetes master and nodes for example are not in the same subnetwork and cannot communicate directly with each other on every port. Hence, you need to ensure that there is a firewall rule that allows incoming traffic from the kubernetes master network to the tcp ports:

* 9443 (loft agent webhook)
* 8443 (loft agent api service extension - v1.cluster.loft.sh)
* 9444 (loft api service extension - v1.management.loft.sh)

## 3. Login
While `loft start` is running in the background, open a second terminal window and sign in via
the CLI:

```bash
loft login https://localhost:9898  --insecure     # See `loft start` output for login credentials
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the
output of `loft start`.
