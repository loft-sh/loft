## Access Keys

Access keys let you authenticate with Loft API endpoints and Loft CLI in non-interactive environments such as from within CI/CD pipelines.


## Create Access Key

## Use Access Key

### Log in via CLI

You can use an access key to log into Loft from non-interactive environments:
```bash
loft login [domain] --access-key=[ACCESS_KEY]

# Retrieve management API kube-context afterwards:
loft use management

# Retrieve users
kubectl get users
```

### Optional: Create Kube-Context manually

You can create the kube config also manually by creating an access key for
your user first and then using the following template, with the following placeholders:

* **$LOFT_HOST**: the loft host you connect to
* **$ACCESS_KEY**: the access key to use

Then replace these placeholders in the following template and save it as `my-kube-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://$LOFT_URL/kubernetes/management
    # Optional: if the server uses an insecure certificate
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
  name: loft
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: loft
    user: loft
  name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
- name: loft
  user:
    token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

You can then access your virtual cluster by using the freshly created kube config file:
```bash
KUBECONFIG=my-kube-config.yaml kubectl get users
```
